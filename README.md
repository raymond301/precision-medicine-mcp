## What and Why
- The Problem: multi-modal precision medicine is siloed and code-heavy
- This Solution: a set of custom MCP servers for analysis and data retrieval (PatientOne use case example):
  - Makes complex analysis significantly faster and easier by presenting a customized, single interface for tools and data
  - System coordinates disparate servers and stitches results together after being given a natural-language prompt
  - "What is an MCP Server?" [(article)](https://medium.com/@elisowski/mcp-explained-the-new-standard-connecting-ai-to-everything-79c5a1c98288)
- What it is NOT: Not clinically validated yet
- Who it’s for: Researchers, Clinicians, Platform Builders, Workflow Architects
- See it / Try it: <5 minute local demo - [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUldOHHX5Yo) | [code](https://github.com/lynnlangit/precision-medicine-mcp/tree/main/tests/manual_testing/PatientOne-OvarianCancer)

## Featured Use Case: PatientOne

<kbd><img src="https://github.com/lynnlangit/precision-medicine-mcp/blob/main/tests/manual_testing/PatientOne-OvarianCancer/architecture/patient-one-holistic.png" width=800></kbd>  

- ANALYZE complete patient profiles using **natural language**
- DEMONSTRATE end-to-end precision medicine workflows
  - Using patient example of Ovarian Cancer (Stage IV HGSOC, platinum-resistant, BRCA1 mutation)
  - Extensible for other comorbidities
- USE 10 MCP servers (9 deployed + mcp-epic local) with 55+ bioinformatics tools
  - Data Modalities: Clinical
    - (Epic FHIR) + Genomic (FGbio, TCGA) +
    - Multi-omics (RNA/Protein/Phospho) +
    - Spatial (Visium) + Imaging (H&E, multiplex IF)
  - Cost Estimates:
    - Demonstration: DRY_RUN demo in 25-35 min (~$1 tokens only) or small files in 1-3 hours ($7-29)
    - Production: Realistic hospital data in 2-4 hours ($24-92 pre-aligned) or 4-8 hours ($29-102 raw FASTQ)
    - Includes: Compute + APIs + Claude tokens (~$1-2, stays low because servers return summaries)
