TEST 2: Multi-Omics Resistance Analysis
========================================

Patient ID: PAT001-OVC-2025

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Data has been copied to MCP-accessible location. Use multiomics server tools to read files.

## Multi-Omics PDX Analysis (use mcp-multiomics)

For patient PAT001-OVC-2025, analyze platinum resistance in PDX models:

### Data Files Location:
Files are in: `patient-data/PAT001-OVC-2025/multiomics/`
- sample_metadata.csv
- pdx_rna_seq.csv
- pdx_proteomics.csv
- pdx_phosphoproteomics.csv

### Analysis Steps:

1. **Load sample metadata:**
   - How many samples total? (Expect: 15)
   - How many resistant vs sensitive? (Expect: 7 resistant, 8 sensitive)

2. **Focus on KEY RESISTANCE GENES ONLY** (to reduce context):
   - **PI3K/AKT pathway:** PIK3CA, AKT1, MTOR, PTEN
   - **Drug resistance:** ABCB1 (MDR1)
   - **Anti-apoptotic:** BCL2L1

   Extract data for these 6 genes from:
   - RNA-seq data
   - Proteomics data
   - Phosphoproteomics data

3. **Run Stouffer's meta-analysis:**
   For each of the 6 genes:
   - Compare resistant vs sensitive samples
   - Use directionality from effect sizes
   - Combine p-values across RNA/Protein/Phospho modalities
   - Apply FDR correction (α = 0.05)

4. **Pathway analysis:**
   - Which genes are significantly dysregulated across ALL three modalities?
   - Is the PI3K/AKT pathway activated in resistant samples?

## Expected Results:

**Sample Counts:**
- Total: 15 PDX samples
- Resistant: 7 samples (PDX_R001-R007)
- Sensitive: 8 samples (PDX_S001-S008)

**Gene Expression Patterns:**
- PIK3CA: Upregulated in resistant (across RNA/Protein/Phospho)
- AKT1: Upregulated in resistant (across all modalities)
- ABCB1: Upregulated in resistant (drug efflux pump)
- BCL2L1: Upregulated in resistant (anti-apoptotic)
- PTEN: Downregulated in resistant (tumor suppressor loss)

**Stouffer's Results:**
- Expected: High Z-scores (Z > 3) for top genes
- Expected: Low p-values (p < 0.001) before FDR
- Expected: FDR-adjusted p < 0.05 for top genes

**Pathway Activation:**
- PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway: **ACTIVATED** in resistant samples
- Evidence: PIK3CA, AKT1, MTOR upregulated; PTEN downregulated

## Output Format:

Please provide:

1. **Sample Summary:**
   - Total samples: 15
   - Resistant: 7, Sensitive: 8
   - Confirm data loaded from all 3 modalities

2. **Gene-Level Results:**
   For each of the 6 genes:
   - Expression in resistant vs sensitive (RNA/Protein/Phospho)
   - Stouffer's combined Z-score
   - Combined p-value
   - FDR-adjusted p-value
   - Direction (up/down in resistant)

3. **Significant Findings:**
   - Which genes pass FDR < 0.05?
   - Which genes are consistent across all 3 modalities?

4. **Pathway Interpretation:**
   - Is PI3K/AKT pathway activated? (Yes/No)
   - Clinical significance for platinum resistance
   - Potential therapeutic targets

## Validation Checkpoints:

✅ Data loaded: 15 samples from 3 modalities
✅ Resistant genes: PIK3CA, AKT1, ABCB1, BCL2L1 upregulated
✅ Tumor suppressor: PTEN downregulated
✅ Stouffer's Z-scores: >3 for top genes
✅ FDR correction: Applied (α=0.05)
✅ Pathway: PI3K/AKT activated
