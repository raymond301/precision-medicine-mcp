# User Interfaces

Three interfaces for interacting with the precision medicine MCP server architecture: 
- **[Dashboard](dashboard/)** - Real-time cost & performance observatory for monitoring token usage, latency, and costs across all 9 MCP servers with optimization recommendations (Streamlit); 
- **[Jupyter Notebook](jupyter-notebook/)** - Interactive data science interface for exploratory analysis and custom workflows with direct MCP server integration; 
- **[Streamlit App](streamlit-app/)** - Clinical chat interface for conversational precision medicine analysis powered by Claude AI with natural language queries. Choose your interface based on use case: Dashboard for architects planning production deployments, Jupyter for researchers building custom analyses, or Streamlit App for clinicians conducting patient consultations. NOTE: There is also a version of the streamlit app for students (w/token guardrails).
