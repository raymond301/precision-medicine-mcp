TEST 4: Histology and Imaging Analysis
=======================================

Patient ID: PAT001-OVC-2025

⚠️ IMPORTANT: This test uses MICROSCOPY IMAGES (TIFF files).
- H&E images use BRIGHTFIELD microscopy (chromogenic stains)
- IF/MxIF images use FLUORESCENCE microscopy (fluorescent antibodies)

**SERVER WORKFLOW:**
- **H&E analysis:** Use mcp-openimagedata ONLY (visual morphology assessment)
- **IF/MxIF analysis:** Use mcp-openimagedata (loading/compositing) + mcp-deepcell (segmentation)
- **DeepCell:** Used for MxIF cell segmentation using DeepCell-TF library (fluorescence images only)

## Imaging Analysis

For patient PAT001-OVC-2025, analyze histology and immunofluorescence images:

### Data Files Location:
Files are in: `patient-data/PAT001-OVC-2025/imaging/`
- PAT001_tumor_HE_20x.tiff (BRIGHTFIELD H&E)
- PAT001_tumor_IF_CD8.tiff (FLUORESCENCE)
- PAT001_tumor_IF_KI67.tiff (FLUORESCENCE)
- PAT001_tumor_multiplex_IF_TP53_KI67_DAPI.tiff (FLUORESCENCE - 3 channels)

### Pre-Flight Validation:

Before starting analysis, verify image quality:

1. **File existence check:**
   - Confirm all 4 TIFF files are accessible
   - Check file sizes are reasonable (~300 KB each as placeholders, or larger for real images)

2. **Image format validation:**
   - H&E image: Should be RGB or grayscale TIFF (brightfield microscopy)
   - IF images: Should be single-channel grayscale TIFF (fluorescence)
   - Multiplex IF: Should be 3-channel TIFF (TP53/KI67/DAPI)

3. **Image dimensions:**
   - Check image width × height (typical: 1000-2000 pixels for 20× magnification)
   - Verify all images from same tissue section have consistent dimensions

4. **Imaging modality verification:**
   - H&E: Confirm it's chromogenic staining (NOT fluorescence)
   - IF images: Confirm fluorescence microscopy format

**If validation fails:** Report specific issues (missing files, incorrect format, dimension mismatches) but continue with best-effort analysis using available images.

### Analysis Steps:

1. **H&E Histology Analysis (use openimagedata):**
   Load PAT001_tumor_HE_20x.tiff
   - This is a BRIGHTFIELD image with chromogenic stains (NOT fluorescence)
   - Hematoxylin stains nuclei blue, Eosin stains cytoplasm pink
   - Describe tissue architecture (glandular patterns, cell density)
   - Are there necrotic regions visible (pale/acellular areas)? (Expect: Yes)
   - Estimate tumor cellularity percentage using visual assessment (Expect: ~70-80%)
   - Overall tissue morphology consistent with HGSOC?

2. **Immunofluorescence - CD8 T Cell Infiltration (use openimagedata + deepcell):**
   Load PAT001_tumor_IF_CD8.tiff
   - This is a FLUORESCENCE image (NOT H&E)
   - Use deepcell to segment nuclei and identify CD8+ cells
   - Quantify CD8+ T cells (cells/mm²)
   - Spatial distribution: Periphery vs infiltrating?
   - Expected: LOW infiltration (~5-15 cells/mm²), primarily at periphery (immune exclusion)

3. **Immunofluorescence - Ki67 Proliferation (use openimagedata + deepcell):**
   Load PAT001_tumor_IF_KI67.tiff
   - This is a FLUORESCENCE image (NOT H&E)
   - Use deepcell to segment cells and identify Ki67+ nuclei
   - Calculate Ki67 proliferation index (% positive cells)
   - Is proliferation uniform or heterogeneous across tissue?
   - Expected: HIGH proliferation (~45-55%), heterogeneous

4. **Multiplex Immunofluorescence (use openimagedata + deepcell):**
   Load PAT001_tumor_multiplex_IF_TP53_KI67_DAPI.tiff
   - This is a FLUORESCENCE multiplex image with 3 channels:
     * Channel 1 (Red): TP53 (mutant p53 accumulation)
     * Channel 2 (Green): KI67 (proliferation marker)
     * Channel 3 (Blue): DAPI (nuclear stain)
   - Use deepcell to segment cells based on DAPI channel
   - Quantify marker expression per cell:
     * TP53+ cells (% of total)
     * KI67+ cells (% of total)
     * TP53+/KI67+ double-positive cells (% of total)
   - Are TP53-mutant cells also highly proliferative?
