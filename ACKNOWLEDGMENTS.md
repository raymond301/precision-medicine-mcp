# Acknowledgments

This project builds upon the work of many contributors in the precision medicine and bioinformatics communities.

## Core Technologies

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Anthropic** - For creating the Model Context Protocol specification and fostering the MCP ecosystem
- **MCP Specification** - [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18)
- **FastMCP Framework** - Python SDK for building MCP servers ([GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk))

### Bioinformatics Research
- **BioinfoMCP Research Team** - Pioneering work on bioinformatics workflows with MCP ([arXiv:2510.02139](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.02139v1))
- **FGbio Toolkit** - FASTQ and VCF quality control utilities ([GitHub](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/fgbio))
- **Seqera Platform** - Nextflow workflow orchestration and execution

## Data & Algorithms

### Public Databases
- **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)** - NIH/NCI public cancer genomics datasets, particularly TCGA-OV ovarian cancer cohort
- **GENCODE** - Human genome annotation consortium
- **KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)** - Pathway database for biological interpretation

### Spatial Transcriptomics
- **10x Genomics** - Visium spatial transcriptomics platform and public datasets
- **STAR Aligner** - RNA-seq alignment algorithm (Dobin et al., 2013)
- **ComBat** - Batch effect correction algorithm (Johnson et al., 2007)

### Multi-Omics Analysis
- **HAllA** - Hierarchical All-against-All association discovery (Rahnavard et al., 2017)
- **Stouffer's Method** - Meta-analysis for combining p-values across omics layers

## Community & Support

### Open Source Projects
This project integrates and builds upon numerous open-source bioinformatics tools:
- **Scanpy** - Single-cell analysis in Python
- **AnnData** - Annotated data structures for computational biology
- **pandas, NumPy, SciPy** - Scientific computing foundation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** - Visualization libraries

### Research Infrastructure
- **Google Cloud Healthcare API** - FHIR data management and de-identification
- **Google Cloud Vertex AI** - Scalable ML infrastructure
- **Hugging Face** - ML model hosting and inference APIs

## Personal Dedication

### PatientOne
This project is dedicated to the memory of a dear friend who passed away from High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma (HGSOC) in 2025. Her courage and grace throughout her battle with cancer inspired the creation of these tools.

**PatientOne** represents:
- The first patient in a precision medicine journey
- A reminder that behind every dataset is a human story
- Hope that AI-orchestrated bioinformatics can accelerate research and improve outcomes for future patients

*"In memory of strength, hope, and the pursuit of better treatments for all patients fighting ovarian cancer."*
