**Issues:**
- Cannot evolve APIs safely
- Breaking changes break all integrations
- No migration path for clients

**Recommendations:**
- Add version to MCP tool names (e.g., `v1_validate_fastq`)
- Document versioning policy
- Support multiple versions during transitions
- Add deprecation warnings
- Plan migration strategy

**Logging Requirements:**
- Log all API version usage (which version called, by which client)
- Track API version adoption metrics (usage by version, migration progress)
- Log deprecation warnings (when deprecated versions are called)
- Include API version in all request logs
- Track API version migration events (clients migrating to new versions)
- Include correlation IDs linking API version usage to requests

**Error Handling Requirements:**
- Handle deprecated API version calls gracefully (warn but still process)
- Handle unsupported API version calls with clear error messages
- Implement version negotiation logic with proper error handling
- Handle API version migration failures gracefully
- Provide detailed version-related error logs for debugging
- Return appropriate error codes for version-related issues

## Summary Statistics

- **Total Improvement Areas:** 20
- **Critical Issues:** 5
- **Medium Priority:** 7
- **Low Priority:** 8
- **Estimated Total Time:** 14-20 weeks (with team of 2-3 developers)
- **Quick Wins Available:** 5 items (~2 weeks)

## Conclusion

This is a well-architected repository with strong documentation and production-ready implementations for core servers. The main gaps are in **automation (CI/CD)**, **security (auth, rate limiting)**, and **operational excellence (monitoring, testing)**. Addressing the critical items first would significantly improve production readiness and security posture.

**Recommended Focus:** Start with Quick Wins, then tackle Critical items, followed by Medium priority improvements. Low priority items can be addressed incrementally as needed.
