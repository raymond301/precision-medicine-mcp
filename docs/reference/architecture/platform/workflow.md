# Workflow Orchestration Architecture

**Status:** ❌ Mocked (Seqera Platform integration ready)
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-10

---

## Executive Summary

Workflow orchestration via the Seqera Platform enables management of Nextflow bioinformatics pipelines at scale. The **mcp-seqera** server provides programmatic access to launch, monitor, and manage workflows from the nf-core pipeline collection and custom pipelines across diverse compute environments (AWS, Azure, GCP, local).

**Key Capabilities:**
- Nextflow pipeline submission (nf-core and custom)
- Multi-cloud workflow execution (AWS Batch, Azure Batch, GCP Batch, local)
- Real-time progress monitoring and resource tracking
- Cost estimation and usage metrics
- Workflow registry access (nf-core pipeline catalog)

---

## Key Workflows

### Workflow 1: Launch RNA-seq Pipeline

```
1. Select pipeline: nf-core/rnaseq
2. Specify input: FASTQ files (S3, GCS, or local paths)
3. Configure params: --genome GRCh38, --aligner star
4. Select compute: AWS Batch (us-east-1)
5. Submit job → Get job ID
6. Monitor progress
```

**Use Case:** Process bulk RNA-seq data from FASTQ to count matrix

**Example Parameters:**
```json
{
  "pipeline": "nf-core/rnaseq",
  "params": {
    "input": "s3://mybucket/samplesheet.csv",
    "genome": "GRCh38",
    "aligner": "star",
    "outdir": "s3://mybucket/results/"
  },
  "compute_env": "aws-batch-us-east-1"
}
```

---

### Workflow 2: Spatial Transcriptomics Processing

```
1. Select pipeline: nf-core/spatial (or custom)
2. Input: Visium FASTQ + tissue images
3. Configure: --chemistry visium, --reference GRCh38
4. Launch on GCP Batch
5. Monitor tissue alignment and count generation
```

**Use Case:** Process raw Visium data to spot × gene count matrix

**Output:** Spot coordinates, gene expression matrix, tissue images

---

### Workflow 3: Monitor Long-Running Job

```
1. Submit variant calling pipeline (nf-core/sarek)
2. Initial status: "Submitted" → "Running"
3. Poll every 5 minutes for progress
4. Track resource usage (CPU hours, memory GB-hours)
5. Receive completion notification
6. Download results
```

**Use Case:** Track multi-hour pipeline execution with cost monitoring

**Example Status:**
```json
{
  "job_id": "abc123",
  "status": "running",
  "progress": 45,
  "tasks_completed": 120,
  "tasks_total": 267,
  "cpu_hours": 42.5,
  "memory_gb_hours": 185.2,
  "estimated_cost_usd": 8.50,
  "runtime_minutes": 125
}
```

## Integration with Other Modalities

### With Spatial Transcriptomics (mcp-spatialtools)

**Integration Point:** Raw FASTQ → Processed count matrix

**Workflow:**
1. Launch nf-core/spatial via mcp-seqera for FASTQ alignment
2. Monitor job until completion
3. Load count matrix into mcp-spatialtools for downstream analysis
4. Run differential expression, pathway enrichment

**Example:** "Process raw Visium FASTQ files, then analyze spatial patterns"

**Pipeline Chain:** mcp-seqera (alignment) → mcp-spatialtools (analysis) → mcp-multiomics (integration)

---

### With Genomic Analysis (mcp-fgbio)

**Integration Point:** Variant calling workflow

**Workflow:**
1. Launch nf-core/sarek for germline/somatic variant calling
2. Monitor variant calling job
3. Load VCF results into mcp-fgbio for annotation
4. Integrate variants with spatial/multi-omics data

**Example:** "Run germline variant calling, then annotate mutations and correlate with expression"

---

### With Multi-omics (mcp-multiomics)

**Integration Point:** Preprocessing large datasets

**Workflow:**
1. Launch custom Nextflow pipeline for multi-omics preprocessing
2. Batch correction, normalization at scale
3. Load preprocessed data into mcp-multiomics
4. Run HAllA association testing

**Example:** "Preprocess 1000-sample proteomics dataset, then run multi-omics integration"

---

## Workflow Lifecycle Management

### Job States

```
Submitted → Queued → Running → Succeeded
                               ↓ (if error)
                             Failed
```

**State Transitions:**
- **Submitted:** Job accepted by Seqera Platform
- **Queued:** Waiting for compute resources
- **Running:** Tasks executing on compute environment
- **Succeeded:** All tasks completed successfully
- **Failed:** One or more tasks failed (check logs)

---

### Resource Tracking

**Metrics Collected:**
- CPU hours (total across all tasks)
- Memory GB-hours (peak memory × duration)
- Disk I/O (read/write volumes)
- Network transfer (data uploaded/downloaded)
- Estimated cost (based on cloud pricing)

**Cost Estimation:**
```
AWS Batch: $0.20/CPU-hour (approximate)
Azure Batch: $0.18/CPU-hour (approximate)
GCP Batch: $0.17/CPU-hour (approximate)
Local HPC: Fixed institutional cost
```

---

### Error Handling

**Automatic Retries:**
- Transient failures: 3 retries with exponential backoff
- Spot instance preemption: Auto-restart on new instance

**Failure Modes:**
- Task failure: Single process error (check task logs)
- Pipeline failure: Workflow configuration error
- Compute failure: Infrastructure issue (insufficient resources)

**Recovery:**
- Resume from checkpoint (if enabled in Nextflow config)
- Re-submit failed tasks only
