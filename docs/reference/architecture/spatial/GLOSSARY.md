# Glossary

---

## A

**Alignment** - Mapping sequencing reads to a reference genome to determine their genomic origin.

**Autocorrelation (Spatial)** - Measure of how similar values are at nearby spatial locations. See Moran's I.

---

## B

**Barcode** - Unique DNA sequence identifying individual spots or cells in spatial transcriptomics.

**Batch Effect** - Technical variation between samples due to processing differences rather than biology.

**BAM** - Binary Alignment Map, compressed format for storing sequence alignments.

---

## C

**Cell Type Deconvolution** - Computational method to infer cell type proportions from bulk tissue expression data.

**ComBat** - Empirical Bayes method for batch effect correction.

**CSV Workflow** - Current PatientOne implementation using pre-processed tabular data.

---

## D

**Differential Expression** - Statistical identification of genes with significantly different expression between conditions.

**DRY_RUN** - Testing mode that returns synthetic data without real processing.

---

## F

**FASTQ** - Text format for storing nucleotide sequences and quality scores from sequencing.

**FASTQ Workflow** - Pipeline processing raw sequencing data from FASTQ files through alignment.

**FDR** - False Discovery Rate, multiple testing correction method (Benjamini-Hochberg).

---

## G

**Geary's C** - Spatial autocorrelation statistic (alternative to Moran's I).

**GO** - Gene Ontology, structured vocabulary for gene functions and processes.

---

## M

**Moran's I** - Spatial autocorrelation statistic measuring clustering of similar values.
- Range: -1 (dispersion) to +1 (clustering)
- 0 indicates random spatial pattern

**MCP** - Model Context Protocol, standard for AI-data integration.

**MxIF** - Multiplexed Immunofluorescence, imaging multiple protein markers on single tissue section.

---

## P

**Pathway Enrichment** - Statistical test for over-representation of genes in biological pathways.

**PHI** - Protected Health Information (HIPAA term for sensitive patient data).

---

## S

**Spatial Transcriptomics** - Technology measuring gene expression with spatial coordinates preserved.

**STAR** - Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference, fast RNA-seq aligner.

**SSE** - Server-Sent Events, HTTP streaming transport for MCP.

---

## U

**UMI** - Unique Molecular Identifier, barcode for PCR duplicate removal and accurate counting.

---

## V

**Visium** - 10x Genomics spatial transcriptomics platform (6.5mm capture area, 5000 spots).

---

## W

**Wilcoxon Test** - Non-parametric statistical test for comparing two groups (rank-based).
