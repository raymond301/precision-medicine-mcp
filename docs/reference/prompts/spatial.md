## Integration with Other Modalities

- Correlate: Gene expression with histological features

Do high-proliferation spots correspond to densely cellular H&E regions?
```

**Expected Output:**

### 18. Combine Spatial + Bulk Multi-Omics

```
Integrate PatientOne spatial transcriptomics with bulk multi-omics:

- Bulk RNA: Confirm overall expression patterns
- Bulk Protein: Validate protein-level changes

Question: Do spatial upregulated genes match bulk RNA/protein?
Are there region-specific effects not captured in bulk?
```

**Expected Output:**
- Concordance: 70% of spatial DE genes significant in bulk RNA
- Region-specific: Immune genes high at edges, not detected in bulk (diluted by tumor-dominant signal)
- Protein validation: VEGFA high in both spatial and bulk protein

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Spatial coordinates missing"**
- Check: `tissue_positions.csv` file present
- Solution: Ensure Visium output includes spatial folder

**"Too few spatially variable genes"**
- Issue: Spatial graph too sparse or threshold too stringent
- Solution: Increase k (neighbors) or relax p-value
- Prompt: `Re-run Moran's I with k=10 and p < 0.1`

**"Batch effects dominate PCA"**
- Issue: Technical variation > biological variation
- Solution: Apply ComBat before downstream analysis
- Prompt: `Apply ComBat batch correction using section ID as batch variable`

**"No enriched pathways found"**
- Issue: Gene set too small or pathways not relevant
- Solution: Use gene-level results or expand pathway databases
- Prompt: `Try GO Biological Process instead of KEGG`
