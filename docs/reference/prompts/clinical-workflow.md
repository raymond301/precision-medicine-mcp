# Clinical Workflow Prompts

**Audience:** Oncologists, Clinical Researchers, Bioinformaticians
**Purpose:** Complete patient analysis workflows for precision oncology
**Time per prompt:** 5-45 minutes
**Expected output:** Clinical reports, treatment recommendations, scientific analysis
**Patient data:** [PatientOne Profile](../shared/patientone-profile.md) (PAT001-OVC-2025)

> **Data Mode Note:** These prompts reference **mcp-mockepic** (synthetic EHR) and **mcp-mocktcga** (synthetic TCGA) — both are always synthetic regardless of DRY_RUN setting.
