Report any formatting issues or inconsistencies.
```

**Expected Output:**
- ✓ All files: Valid CSV format
- ✓ Sample IDs: Consistent across modalities (15 samples)

### 16. Missing Data Analysis

**Objective:** Understand patterns of missing data

```

- Phospho: % missing (often higher)

Identify:
- Genes with excessive missingness (> 30%)
- Samples with excessive missingness (> 20%)

Recommend imputation strategy if needed.
```

**Expected Output:**
- RNA: 2% missing (minimal)
- Protein: 15% missing (typical for proteomics)
- Phospho: 22% missing (low-abundance phosphosites)
- Pattern: MCAR (missing at random)
- Recommendation: Use k-nearest neighbors imputation for protein/phospho

**Customize:**

## Troubleshooting

**"Sample IDs don't match across modalities"**
- Check: Sample naming conventions (e.g., "Sample_01" vs. "Sample01")
- Solution: Standardize IDs before loading
- Prompt: `Rename samples to match: Sample_01 → Sample01`

**"Too many significant genes (> 1000)"**
- Issue: Threshold too lenient or large effect sizes
- Solution: Increase stringency (FDR < 0.01) or add fold change filter
- Prompt: `Re-analyze with FDR < 0.01 and log2FC > 1.5`

**"No concordance between RNA and protein"**
- Issue: Post-translational regulation, technical noise, or batch effects
- Solution: Check batch effects, assess protein data quality
- Prompt: `Assess batch effects and protein data quality for PatientOne`

**"Stouffer meta-analysis finds nothing"**
- Issue: Effects in opposite directions across modalities
- Solution: Check individual modalities first, may be biology (PTM regulation)
- Prompt: `Compare RNA vs. Protein direction for top DE genes`
