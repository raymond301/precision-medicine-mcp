- Why platinum resistance might develop?
- What does BRCA status mean for prognosis?
```

**Expected Output:**
- **TP53 mutation:** Explains high-grade histology and aggressive behavior
  - p53 loss removes cell cycle checkpoints
  - Associated with 96% of HGSOC cases
- **BRCA1 germline:** Initially sensitive to platinum/PARP

### 17. Identify Immunotherapy Targets and Biomarkers

**Objective:** Assess PatientOne's tumor for immunotherapy target expression to evaluate candidacy for next-generation immunotherapies (bispecifics, vaccines, TIL therapy)

```
For PatientOne (PAT001-OVC-2025), analyze expression of immunotherapy-relevant
targets and biomarkers across available multi-omics and spatial data.

Data location: gs://sample-inputs-patientone/patient-data/PAT001-OVC-2025/

Check the following target categories:

1. Checkpoint ligands (cadonilimab PD-1xCTLA-4 candidacy):
   - CD274 (PD-L1): Expression level and spatial distribution
   - CTLA4: Expression on T cells in stroma/periphery
   - LAG3, HAVCR2 (TIM3), TIGIT: Alternative checkpoint targets
   → If PD-L1 low but CTLA-4 present: dual blockade (cadonilimab) may be effective

2. BiTE targets (ubamatamab MUC16xCD3 candidacy):
   - MUC16: Expression level (correlates with CA-125 serum levels)
   - CD3D, CD3E: T-cell presence (even if excluded from tumor)
   → If MUC16 high + CD3+ cells in stroma: ubamatamab can redirect T cells

3. Innate immune targets (NI-1801 MSLNxCD47 candidacy):
   - MSLN (mesothelin): Tumor cell expression
   - CD47: "Don't eat me" signal on tumor cells
   - CD68: Macrophage presence in tumor/stroma
   → If MSLN+ tumor + CD68+ macrophages present: NI-1801 can activate phagocytosis

4. Vaccine targets (IGFBP-2 vaccine candidacy):
   - IGFBP2: Overexpression in tumor vs. normal tissue
   → If IGFBP2 overexpressed: vaccine can generate targeted T-cell response

5. TIL feasibility markers (TIL therapy candidacy):
   - CD8A: Presence at tumor periphery/stroma (TIL harvest site)
   - Exhaustion markers: PDCD1 (PD-1), LAG3, HAVCR2, TIGIT on CD8+ cells
   - Activation markers: GZMB, PRF1 (if available)
   → If CD8+ at periphery with moderate exhaustion: TIL can be expanded ex vivo

For each target, report:
- Expression level (High/Medium/Low/Not detected/Not in panel)
- Spatial distribution (tumor core, stroma, periphery, interface)
- Immunotherapy candidacy assessment
- Data source (Visium spatial, multi-omics RNA, multi-omics protein)

NOTE: Not all targets may be present in PatientOne's synthetic 31-gene Visium
panel. For targets not in the spatial panel, check multi-omics RNA data.
If unavailable in both, note as "Not in current panel — requires additional assay."
```

**Expected Output:**

| Target | Expression | Location | Source | Therapy Candidacy |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------|-------------------|
| CD274 (PD-L1) | Low | Stroma interface | Spatial/RNA | Low for mono; consider combination |
| CTLA4 | Low-Medium | T cells in stroma | RNA | Supports dual blockade (cadonilimab) |
| MUC16 | High | Tumor core + periphery | Clinical (CA-125) | Strong ubamatamab candidate |
| CD3D/CD3E | Medium | Stroma, excluded from tumor | Spatial | T cells present for BiTE redirection |
| MSLN | Medium-High | Tumor cells | RNA | NI-1801 candidate (verify expression) |
| CD47 | High | Tumor cells | RNA | CD47 blockade relevant |
| CD68 | Medium | Stroma | Spatial/Imaging | Macrophages available for NI-1801 |
| IGFBP2 | Check RNA | Tumor | RNA | Vaccine candidate if overexpressed |
| CD8A | Low (tumor), Medium (stroma) | Periphery/stroma | Spatial/Imaging | TIL harvest feasible from periphery |
| PDCD1 (PD-1) | Medium | CD8+ T cells | RNA | Moderate exhaustion — TIL expandable |

**Customize:**
- Add/remove targets based on available panel genes
- Adjust for different cancer types (different target priorities)
- Focus on specific therapy: e.g., `Focus only on BiTE targets for ubamatamab assessment`

**Reference:** See [Immunotherapy Reference](../testing/patient-one/immunotherapy-reference.md) for detailed candidate profiles and decision framework.

## Troubleshooting

**"VCF file not found"**
- Check file path is correct
- Verify patient ID matches directory name
- Use: `List available genomic data files` first

**"No pathogenic variants found"**
- Expand gene list (include more cancer genes)
- Lower variant quality threshold (check low-quality calls)
- Check if VCF is annotated (clinical significance field)

**"FHIR data empty"**
- Verify patient ID exists in clinical database
- Check DRY_RUN mode (uses synthetic data)
- Try mcp-mockepic instead of mcp-epic for demos
