TEST 6: Clinician-in-the-Loop (CitL) Review & Approval
========================================================

Patient ID: PAT001-OVC-2025
Cancer Type: High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma (HGSOC), Stage IV, Platinum-Resistant

⚠️ PREREQUISITE: Complete TEST_5_INTEGRATION before running this test

## Overview

This test implements the formal Clinician-in-the-Loop (CitL) validation workflow where an oncologist reviews and validates the "stitched results" from TEST_1-5 before they are finalized into a clinical report. This demonstrates AI as a "co-pilot" rather than an autonomous decision-maker in high-stakes oncology care.

**Workflow:** Draft Report → Automated QC → Clinician Review → Approve/Revise/Reject → Final Report

**Time Estimate:** 30-45 minutes total
- Automated steps: ~40 seconds
- Manual clinician review: 20-30 minutes

**New Concepts:**
- Draft vs. Approved Reports
- Automated Quality Gates
- Structured Clinical Review
- Digital Signatures & Audit Trail
- HIPAA-Compliant 10-Year Retention

---

## STEP 1: Generate Draft Clinical Report (Automated, ~30 seconds)

### Run the Enhanced Report Generator

```bash
cd /Users/lynnlangit/Documents/GitHub/spatial-mcp

python servers/mcp-patient-report/scripts/generate_patient_report.py \
  --patient-id PAT001-OVC-2025 \
  --output-dir ./results \
  --generate-draft
```

**What this does:**
1. Consolidates findings from TEST_1 (clinical), TEST_2 (multiomics), TEST_3 (spatial), TEST_4 (imaging), TEST_5 (integration)
2. Runs automated quality checks (6 checks: sample size, FDR thresholds, data completeness, cross-modal consistency, etc.)
3. Generates structured JSON output for review workflow
4. Flags issues requiring clinician attention

### Expected Output Files

✅ **draft_report.json** - Structured findings for CitL review
- Contains: patient metadata, quality checks, clinical findings from all 5 tests, key molecular findings (top 10), treatment recommendations, quality flags

✅ **quality_checks.json** - Automated QC results
- Sample size check: ≥30 spots/region
- FDR thresholds: FDR < 0.05 for significant DEGs
- Data completeness: >95% non-missing
- Cross-modal consistency: RNA-protein correlation

✅ **clinical_summary.txt** - Human-readable summary
- Plain language summary of findings
- Treatment implications
- Monitoring recommendations

### Quality Gate Validation

Verify all quality checks passed (or flags documented):

- [ ] **Sample sizes adequate:** tumor_core ≥30 spots, stroma ≥30 spots
- [ ] **FDR thresholds met:** All significant DEGs have FDR < 0.05
- [ ] **Data completeness:** >95% of expression values present
- [ ] **Cross-modal consistency:** TP53 mutation (genomics) matches TP53+ cells (imaging)

**If quality checks fail:**
- Review `quality_checks.json` for details
- Assess whether flags are acceptable or require action
- Document assessment in clinician review (Section 4)

---

## STEP 2: Clinician Review (Manual, 20-30 minutes)

### Reviewer Role

**Primary Reviewer:** Dr. Sarah Johnson
**Credentials:** MD, Gynecologic Oncology
**Role:** Oncologist specializing in ovarian cancer

**Review Objectives:**
1. Validate molecular findings against clinical presentation
2. Assess NCCN guideline compliance
3. Evaluate treatment recommendation appropriateness
4. Review quality flags
5. Make final approval decision

✅ Report finalization complete!

📍 Next Steps:
   1. Review final report: ./results/PAT001-OVC-2025/final_report_approved.json
   2. Present findings at tumor board
   3. Document clinical decision in patient chart
   4. Archive audit trail (10-year retention)
```

### Verification

```bash
# View final report
cat ./results/PAT001-OVC-2025/final_report_approved.json | python -m json.tool | less

# Verify status
grep '"status"' ./results/PAT001-OVC-2025/final_report_approved.json
# Should show: "status": "clinically_approved"

# Verify attestation is included
grep -A 5 '"clinical_attestation"' ./results/PAT001-OVC-2025/final_report_approved.json
```

---

## STEP 4B: Handle Revisions (If review status = REVISE)

**Run this workflow ONLY if clinician requested revisions.**

### Review Revision Instructions

```bash
# View revision instructions from signed review
cat ./results/PAT001-OVC-2025/citl_review_completed_signed.json | python -m json.tool | grep -A 20 '"revision_instructions"'
```

**Example revision instructions:**
- Exclude tumor_necrotic region (insufficient sample size)
- Increase FDR threshold from 0.05 to 0.01
- Validate TP53 mutation with orthogonal sequencing

### Re-run Analysis with Adjusted Parameters

```bash
# Example: Re-run with stricter FDR and exclude regions
python servers/mcp-patient-report/scripts/generate_patient_report.py \
  --patient-id PAT001-OVC-2025 \
  --output-dir ./results \
  --generate-draft \
  --fdr-threshold 0.01 \
  --min-spots-per-region 50 \
  --exclude-regions tumor_necrotic,stroma_artifact
```

### Resubmit for Review

After addressing issues:

1. New draft report generated (version 2)
2. Return to STEP 2 (Clinician Review)
3. Complete new review with `revision_count: 1`
4. Submit review again (STEP 3)

---

## STEP 4C: Handle Rejection (If review status = REJECT)

**Run this workflow ONLY if clinician rejected the report.**

### Escalation Procedure

1. **Review rejection rationale:**
   ```bash
   cat ./results/PAT001-OVC-2025/citl_review_completed_signed.json | python -m json.tool | grep -A 5 '"rationale"'
   ```

2. **Document critical errors** from review form Section 7

3. **Alert team:**
   - Bioinformatics team lead
   - Principal Investigator
   - Clinical research coordinator

4. **Schedule review meeting** to determine:
   - Root cause of errors
   - Whether data re-collection needed
   - Alternative analysis approach
   - Expert consultation requirements

5. **Create corrective action plan**

6. **Timeline:** Major re-analysis may require 1-2 weeks

---

## Expected Results for PatientOne (APPROVE Scenario)

### Quality Checks: ✅ ALL PASS

- **Sample sizes:** tumor_core (350 spots), stroma (400 spots) - PASS
- **FDR thresholds:** 17 DEGs with FDR < 0.05 - PASS
- **Data completeness:** 99.2% - PASS
- **Cross-modal consistency:** TP53 mutation (genomics) + TP53+ cells (imaging) - PASS

### Expected Clinician Decision: APPROVE

**Rationale:** "All findings are consistent with clinical presentation and imaging. Molecular results align with observed platinum resistance. Treatment recommendations follow NCCN guidelines and are appropriate for patient's molecular profile."

### Key Findings Validated: 10/10 CONFIRMED

1. ✅ TP53 R175H mutation
2. ✅ PIK3CA E545K activation
3. ✅ BRCA1 germline pathogenic
4. ✅ ABCB1 upregulation (platinum resistance)
5. ✅ BCL2L1 anti-apoptotic signaling
6. ✅ Immune exclusion (low CD8)
7. ✅ Tumor hypoxia (VEGFA)
8. ✅ High Ki67 proliferation
9. ✅ PI3K/AKT pathway activation
10. ✅ MDR1 drug efflux

### Guideline Compliance: ALIGNED

- **NCCN:** ALIGNED (BRCA1+ HGSOC guidelines followed)
- **Institutional:** ALIGNED (all drugs in formulary, trial available)

### Expected Review Time: 25 minutes

- Draft review: 10 minutes
- Per-finding validation: 8 minutes
- Guideline assessment: 5 minutes
- Form completion: 2 minutes

### Expected Outcome

- ✅ Status: APPROVED
- ✅ Final report generated
- ✅ Audit trail complete with digital signature
- ✅ Ready for tumor board presentation

---

## Validation Checkpoints

✅ **Automated quality gates** run before human review (6 checks)  
✅ **Structured review** captured all 4 required review scopes:  
   - High-level decision (APPROVE)  
   - Per-finding validation (10 findings confirmed)  
   - Guideline compliance (NCCN + institutional aligned)  
   - Digital attestation with signature  

✅ **Audit trail** with immutable timestamp and signature hash  
✅ **10-year retention** compliance (logged to Cloud Logging)  
✅ **Final approved report** ready for clinical use  
✅ **Workflow integration** seamlessly extends TEST_1-5  

---

## Integration with Existing Workflow

### Previous Workflow (TEST_1-5):
```
TEST_1 (Clinical) → TEST_2 (Multiomics) → TEST_3 (Spatial) →
TEST_4 (Imaging) → TEST_5 (Integration) → Manual Review
```

### New Workflow with CitL (TEST_1-6):
```
TEST_1 (Clinical) → TEST_2 (Multiomics) → TEST_3 (Spatial) →
TEST_4 (Imaging) → TEST_5 (Integration) →
**TEST_6 (CitL Review)** → APPROVED CLINICAL REPORT
```

### Time Comparison

**Before CitL (informal review):**
- TEST_1-5: 10-15 minutes (LLM analysis)
- Manual review: Unstructured, no audit trail, variable quality
- **Total: 10-15 minutes** (but clinically insufficient)

**After CitL (formal review):**
- TEST_1-5: 10-15 minutes (LLM analysis)
- TEST_6 automated QC: 30 seconds
- TEST_6 clinician review: 20-30 minutes (structured, auditable)
- **Total: 30-45 minutes** (production-ready, clinically valid)

### Value Added by CitL

1. **Clinical accountability:** Oncologist validates AI findings  
2. **HIPAA compliance:** 10-year audit trail with signatures  
3. **Guideline alignment:** Explicit NCCN + institutional check  
4. **Quality assurance:** Automated QC gates before human review  
5. **Workflow transparency:** Clear approve/revise/reject process  
6. **AI as co-pilot:** Human expert in the loop, not autonomous AI

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Schema validation fails

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify JSON syntax
python -m json.tool ./results/PAT001-OVC-2025/citl_review_completed.json

# Check required fields
grep -E '"patient_id"|"reviewer"|"decision"|"attestation"' ./results/PAT001-OVC-2025/citl_review_completed.json
```

### Issue: Cloud Logging not available

**Solution:** Script automatically falls back to local logging
```bash
# Check local audit trail
cat citl_review_audit_trail.jsonl
```

### Issue: Cannot finalize (status not APPROVE)

**Solution:** Check review decision
```bash
# View decision status
cat ./results/PAT001-OVC-2025/citl_review_completed_signed.json | python -m json.tool | grep -A 3 '"decision"'

# If REVISE: See STEP 4B
# If REJECT: See STEP 4C
```

### Issue: Draft report not found

**Solution:** Run generate_patient_report.py first
```bash
# Generate draft report
python servers/mcp-patient-report/scripts/generate_patient_report.py --patient-id PAT001-OVC-2025 --output-dir ./results --generate-draft
```

---
