# Archived Documentation

⚠️ **WARNING:** This directory contains outdated documentation that is no longer maintained.

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-14

---

## Purpose

This archive preserves historical documentation for reference purposes only. Archived documents should **NOT** be used for:
- Current implementation
- Production deployment
- Research analysis
- Clinical decision-making

**For current documentation**, see [docs/INDEX.md](../../INDEX.md).

---

## Current Archive Status

**Files Currently Archived:** 0

**Reason:** All documentation was recently reviewed and updated during the 2026-01 documentation reorganization (Phases 1-6). All files have recent "Last Updated" dates (December 2025 or later) and remain actively maintained.

---

## Archiving Criteria

Documents are moved to this archive when they meet **ANY** of these criteria:

### 1. **Outdated (Time-based)**
- Last updated **before October 2025** (6+ months old)
- **AND** not recently validated as still current
- **AND** superseded by newer documentation

### 2. **Marked Obsolete**
- Explicitly marked as "POC only - NOT for production"
- Contains warnings "DEPRECATED" or "DO NOT USE"
- References removed features or discontinued approaches

### 3. **Superseded**
- Content fully replaced by comprehensive newer docs
- Old persona guides replaced by `/docs/for-*/` directories
- Consolidated content (multiple old files → one new file)

### 4. **No Longer Applicable**
- References technologies or approaches no longer in use
- Describes workflows that have been completely redesigned
- Contains instructions for deprecated deployment methods

### Criteria for **NOT** Archiving:
- ❌ Documents with warnings about specific methods (e.g., "not recommended for production" about one deployment option)
- ❌ Work-in-progress notes within active documents
- ❌ Temporary instructions or troubleshooting steps
- ❌ Phase references for active roadmaps ("Phase 1 current, Phase 2 planned")
