## Data Retention

| Data Type | Retention | Storage |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Audit logs | **10 years** (HIPAA requirement) | Cloud Logging (immutable) |
| Clinical data | 7 years archive | Cloud Storage (AES-256) |
| Analysis results | 90 days nearline, then archive | Cloud Storage |
| PHI (pre-de-identification) | Not stored in MCP system | Epic FHIR only |

## PHI Handling

- PHI is de-identified **before** entering the MCP system
- The MCP system processes only de-identified data
- No PHI is stored on local devices (web-based system)
- Epic FHIR client handles de-identification at the source
