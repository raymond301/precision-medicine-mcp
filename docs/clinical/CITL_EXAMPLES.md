### Key Decision Points

**Why APPROVE?**
1. ✅ All 10 findings CONFIRMED with strong clinical rationale
2. ✅ Quality checks passed (one minor warning acceptable)
3. ✅ NCCN-aligned treatment recommendations
4. ✅ Findings consistent with clinical presentation (platinum resistance, imaging, IHC)
5. ✅ Confident presenting at tumor board

**Review Time Breakdown:**
- Clinical summary review: 5 minutes
- Per-finding validation (10 findings): 12 minutes
- Guideline compliance: 3 minutes
- Quality flags: 2 minutes
- Treatment recommendations: 3 minutes
- **Total: 25 minutes**

**Next Steps:**
1. Run finalization script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/finalize_patient_report.py --patient-id PAT001-OVC-2025
   ```
2. Present at tumor board (Tuesday)
3. Discuss clinical trial enrollment with patient
4. Document decision in EHR

## Example 2: REVISE - Quality Flag Requires Action

**Scenario:** Breast cancer, ER+/HER2-, Stage III. Quality flag raised for inadequate sample size in one region. Findings from that region have marginal FDR values. Clinician determines re-analysis is needed with region excluded.

**Review Time:** 30 minutes
**Expected Outcome:** Re-analysis with adjusted parameters, resubmission for review

### Key Decision Points

**Why REVISE (not APPROVE)?**
1. ⚠️ Quality flag requires action (sample size < 30)
2. ⚠️ Three findings UNCERTAIN due to marginal FDR values
3. ⚠️ Insufficient statistical power in one region
4. ✅ Other findings valid, no NCCN deviations
5. ⚠️ Cannot confidently use uncertain findings for treatment decisions

**Why REVISE (not REJECT)?**
- Majority of findings (7/10) are CONFIRMED from adequate regions
- Issue is localized to one small region
- Clear path to resolution (exclude problematic region)
- Treatment recommendations still appropriate
- No critical errors or data integrity issues

**Review Time Breakdown:**
- Clinical summary review: 6 minutes
- Per-finding validation: 14 minutes (extra time assessing tumor_edge findings)
- Guideline compliance: 3 minutes
- Quality flags: 3 minutes (assessing impact on validity)
- Treatment recommendations: 2 minutes
- Revision instructions (Section 7): 4 minutes
- **Total: 32 minutes**

**Next Steps:**
1. Bioinformatics team receives revision instructions
2. Re-run analysis excluding tumor_edge region, min spots = 50
3. Generate new draft report (version 2)
4. Clinician reviews version 2 (expected time: 15-20 minutes, faster than initial)
5. Likely outcome: APPROVE on version 2

---

## Example 3: REJECT - Critical Data Error

**Scenario:** Lung adenocarcinoma, Stage IV. Report shows EGFR exon 19 deletion, but patient's prior molecular testing (6 months ago, FoundationOne) showed EGFR wild-type. Critical inconsistency suggests sample mix-up or data error.

**Review Time:** 35 minutes
**Expected Outcome:** Escalation to PI/bioinformatics team, investigation, complete re-analysis

### Key Decision Points

**Why REJECT (not REVISE)?**
1. ❌ **Critical error:** EGFR mutation contradicts prior definitive testing
2. ❌ **Patient safety:** Recommending inappropriate targeted therapy (EGFR TKI)
3. ❌ **Data integrity concern:** Suspect sample mix-up (most serious error)
4. ❌ **Cannot use ANY findings:** Validity of entire report is questionable
5. ❌ **Requires investigation:** Not just parameter adjustment, need root cause analysis

**Why REJECT (not just flag and continue)?**
- Acting on incorrect molecular data could harm patient (inappropriate therapy, missed correct therapy)
- Sample mix-up affects ALL findings, not just one gene
- Regulatory/ethical requirement to ensure correct patient-sample matching
- EGFR status is actionable and treatment-determining in NSCLC

**Review Time Breakdown:**
- Clinical summary review: 7 minutes
- Identifying EGFR discrepancy: 5 minutes (reviewing prior reports)
- Per-finding validation: 10 minutes (marking as UNCERTAIN due to sample concern)
- Guideline compliance: 3 minutes
- Treatment recommendations: 3 minutes
- Revision instructions (Section 7): 10 minutes (detailed investigation plan)
- **Total: 38 minutes**

**Next Steps:**
1. **Immediate:** Alert bioinformatics team and PI (critical error)
2. **Day 1:** Schedule emergency meeting (clinician, bioinformatics, lab director)
3. **Day 2-3:** Sample verification (SNP fingerprinting)
4. **Day 4-7:** Investigation and root cause analysis
   - If sample mix-up → Identify correct sample, re-run analysis
   - If data error → Debug pipeline, validate EGFR call, re-run from raw data
5. **Day 10-14:** Complete re-analysis and resubmit for review
6. **Patient care:** Continue with standard platinum chemotherapy (per prior FoundationOne results) while investigation ongoing. Do NOT start EGFR TKI.

## Comparison Table

| Aspect | APPROVE | REVISE | REJECT |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Decision Status** | All findings valid, ready for clinical use | Findings mostly valid, needs corrections | Critical error, cannot use report |
| **Confidence Level** | High - comfortable presenting at tumor board | Medium - need adjustments before clinical use | Low - data validity in question |
| **Findings Validation** | 8-10 CONFIRMED, 0-2 UNCERTAIN, 0 INCORRECT | 5-8 CONFIRMED, 2-5 UNCERTAIN, 0-2 INCORRECT | 0-3 CONFIRMED, 5-10 UNCERTAIN, 1-3 INCORRECT |
| **Quality Flags** | All ACCEPTABLE | 1-2 REQUIRES_ACTION | Critical flags or data integrity concern |
| **Guideline Compliance** | ALIGNED or PARTIAL (justified) | ALIGNED (but molecular rationale needs strengthening) | NOT_ALIGNED (based on invalid data) |
| **Treatment Recs** | AGREE with all/most | AGREE with most (pending molecular confirmation) | DISAGREE with key recommendations |
| **Next Step** | Finalize report → Tumor board | Re-analysis → Resubmit for review | Investigation → Root cause analysis → Complete re-analysis |
| **Timeline** | Immediate (same day) | 3-5 days (re-analysis) | 1-2 weeks (investigation + re-analysis) |
| **Severity** | None - routine approval | Minor - needs refinement | Critical - patient safety concern |
| **Section 7 Required?** | No | Yes - specific re-analysis instructions | Yes - detailed investigation plan |
| **Review Time** | 20-25 minutes | 25-35 minutes | 30-40 minutes |
| **Typical Frequency** | 70-80% of reviews | 15-25% of reviews | 5-10% of reviews |

## Key Takeaways

### When to APPROVE
✅ All findings consistent with clinical presentation
✅ Quality checks passed (or minor warnings that don't affect validity)
✅ Treatment recommendations follow guidelines
✅ You're confident using this report for clinical decision-making
✅ Ready to present findings at tumor board

### When to REVISE
⚠️ Findings are mostly valid but have issues requiring correction
⚠️ Quality flags that need addressing (e.g., small sample size, borderline FDR values)
⚠️ Treatment recommendations need refinement
⚠️ Clear, actionable path to resolution (exclude regions, adjust parameters, add validation)
⚠️ Not ready for tumor board YET, but will be after corrections

### When to REJECT
❌ Critical errors in findings (wrong patient data, major inconsistencies)
❌ Data integrity concerns (sample mix-up, severe quality issues)
❌ Patient safety at risk (inappropriate therapy based on invalid data)
❌ Requires investigation and root cause analysis (not just parameter tweaking)
❌ Cannot use ANY findings from report until resolved

### Decision-Making Framework

**Ask yourself:**
1. **Would I present these findings at tumor board?**
   - Yes → APPROVE
   - Not yet, but close → REVISE
   - No, something is wrong → REJECT

2. **Would I start treatment based on these findings?**
   - Yes → APPROVE
   - Yes, but with additional validation → REVISE
   - No, data may be incorrect → REJECT

3. **What's the primary issue?**
   - No significant issues → APPROVE
   - Statistical power, minor quality flags → REVISE
   - Data validity, patient safety → REJECT

4. **How confident am I in the findings?**
   - High (>90%) → APPROVE
   - Medium (60-90%) → REVISE
   - Low (<60%) → REJECT

### Best Practices

1. **Always review prior molecular testing reports** - Catch discrepancies early
2. **Don't ignore quality flags** - Even "minor" warnings can indicate real issues
3. **Be specific in revision instructions** - "Improve quality" is not actionable
4. **Document your reasoning** - Future reviewers and auditors will read your comments
5. **Err on the side of caution** - When in doubt, REVISE rather than APPROVE
6. **Patient safety first** - REJECT if any concern about data validity or patient harm
