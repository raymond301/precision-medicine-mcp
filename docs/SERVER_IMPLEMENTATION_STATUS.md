# MCP Server Implementation Status Matrix

**Last Updated:** December 29, 2025
**Purpose:** Clearly document what's real vs mocked in each server to prevent accidental use of synthetic data

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING

**Before using any server in production or for research decisions:**

1. Check this document to verify the server has real implementation (not mocked)
2. Verify `DRY_RUN` environment variable is set to `false`
3. Review the "Safe for Production?" status below
4. Test with known data to validate results

**Using mocked servers for research decisions will produce SYNTHETIC RESULTS that do not reflect reality.**

### ❌ mcp-tcga (0% Real Implementation)

**Overall Status:** **FULLY MOCKED - ALL RESULTS ARE SYNTHETIC**
**Testing:** 5 smoke tests, 35% code coverage
**Safe for Production:** **NO**

#### ❌ All Tools Return Synthetic Data

| Tool | Real Implementation | What It Actually Does |
|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| `query_tcga_cohorts` | ❌ 0% | Returns hardcoded list: ["TCGA-OV", "TCGA-BRCA", "TCGA-LUAD"] |
| `fetch_expression_data` | ❌ 0% | Returns `np.random.randn()` - random numbers |
| `compare_to_cohort` | ❌ 0% | Returns synthetic z-scores with no real comparison |
| `get_survival_data` | ❌ 0% | Returns fake survival curves |
| `get_mutation_data` | ❌ 0% | Returns mock mutation frequencies |

#### Why Fully Mocked

**Technical Reason:**
- TCGA GDC API client not yet implemented
- Requires authentication setup with NIH GDC
- API integration estimated at 1 week of development

**Data Availability:**
- TCGA data is **FREE and PUBLIC** via GDC API
- No cost or API key barriers (unlike HuggingFace)
- Purely a development priority issue

#### DRY_RUN Behavior

**Both `TCGA_DRY_RUN=true` and `TCGA_DRY_RUN=false` return synthetic data**

This server is 100% mocked regardless of DRY_RUN setting.

#### Production Readiness Assessment

**❌ ABSOLUTELY NOT SAFE FOR PRODUCTION**

**Critical Risk:**
- Any cohort comparisons are FICTIONAL
- Any survival data is RANDOM
- Any mutation frequencies are MADE UP

**Example of Danger:**
```python
# What you see:
result = get_mutation_data("TP53", "TCGA-OV")
# Returns: {"mutation_frequency": 0.82, "samples_mutated": 164}

# Reality:
# This is np.random.uniform(0.6, 0.95) - completely synthetic!
# Real TP53 mutation rate in ovarian cancer: ~96% (very different!)
```

**Recommended Action:**

**Option 1: Implement Real TCGA API (RECOMMENDED)**
- Estimated effort: 1 week
- Use GDC API client: https://gdc.cancer.gov/developers/gdc-application-programming-interface-api
- Cost: $0 (TCGA data is free)

**Option 2: Remove from Production Config**
- Remove mcp-tcga from `claude_desktop_config.json`
- Document as "demo only" in README
- Use external tools for TCGA comparison

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Use current implementation for any research decisions
- ❌ Include in PatientOne workflow with real data
- ❌ Cite results in publications

- AWS GPU instance: ~$0.50-1.00/hour

#### DRY_RUN Behavior

**Both `DEEPCELL_DRY_RUN=true` and `DEEPCELL_DRY_RUN=false` return synthetic data**

#### Production Readiness Assessment

**❌ NOT SAFE FOR PRODUCTION**

**Path to Production:**
1. Install TensorFlow (CPU or GPU version)
2. Download Mesmer model weights from DeepCell library
3. Implement actual cell segmentation (wrap DeepCell API)
4. Test on benchmark datasets (known cell counts)
5. Estimated effort: 1 week + GPU setup

**Alternative:**

**Cost:**
- Seqera Platform: Free tier available
- Compute costs: Depends on infrastructure (AWS/GCP/local)

#### Production Readiness Assessment

**❌ NOT SAFE FOR PRODUCTION**

**Path to Production:**
1. Create Seqera Platform account
2. Configure access tokens
3. Integrate Seqera Platform API
4. Test with small nf-core pipelines
5. Estimated effort: 1 week

**Safe servers + conditional:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "multiomics": { ... },
    "fgbio": { ... },
    "spatialtools": {
      "command": "/path/to/mcp-spatialtools/venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["-m", "mcp_spatialtools"],
      "env": {
        "SPATIAL_DRY_RUN": "false",
        "SPATIAL_DATA_DIR": "/data/spatial"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**⚠️ WARNING:** STAR alignment and DE are still mocked!

**Safe operations:**
- Quality filtering
- Region segmentation
- Data preprocessing

**NOT safe:**
- Alignment
- Differential expression
- Batch correction

**Cost:** $8-10 per patient (if you add STAR externally)
**Risk:** Medium

---

**❌ DO NOT deploy this configuration:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    // Including mcp-tcga, mcp-deepcell, mcp-huggingface, mcp-seqera
    // DANGER: These return SYNTHETIC data!
  }
}
```

**Why dangerous:**
- 5 servers are fully mocked
- Results will be synthetic but may look real
- High risk of incorrect research conclusions
