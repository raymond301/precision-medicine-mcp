# Production Roadmap: Hospital Cloud Deployment

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the prioritized path to move the Precision Medicine MCP POC from development to production deployment in a hospital cloud infrastructure for testing with actual patient data.

**POC Status (2025-12-30):** All 9 servers deployed to GCP Cloud Run, tested via Claude API
**Next Goal:** HIPAA-compliant hospital deployment with real patient data
**Timeline Estimate:** 24 weeks (6 months) for Phase 1-3

**Note:** Healthcare deployments require longer timelines than typical AdTech/FinTech projects due to HIPAA compliance, clinical validation, and practitioner review requirements.

---

## Prioritization Rationale

### Why This Order?

1. **Infrastructure First** - Nothing else works without secure foundation
2. **Clinical Data (EHR) First** - Patient data is the starting point for all analysis
3. **Spatial Analysis Second** - Core of the patient-one use case (ovarian cancer)
4. **Imaging Third** - Complements spatial analysis
5. **Genomics Fourth** - Provides comparative context
6. **ML/Workflow Last** - Nice-to-have, not critical path

### What We're NOT Prioritizing (and Why)

- **mcp-seqera** - Can use direct Nextflow execution instead
- **Advanced ML inference** - Discovery is sufficient for Phase 1-3
- **Full DeepCell implementation** - API integration sufficient initially

## Decision Points for User

Before proceeding, please confirm:

1. **Infrastructure:** Which cloud provider? (Azure/AWS/GCP)
2. **EHR System:** Epic, Cerner, other? API access available?
3. **Timeline:** Is 24 weeks (6 months) acceptable?
4. **Resources:** Team availability for work?
5. **Clinical Partner:** Hospital/clinic identified and engaged?
6. **Regulatory:** IRB submission timeline?
7. **Budget:** $150K-250K budget available?

---

## Immediate Next Steps

**If greenlit, Week 1 tasks:**

1. **Kickoff meeting** with hospital IT, security, clinical teams
2. **Cloud environment setup** (Azure/AWS/GCP healthcare tier)
3. **EHR integration scoping** (meet with Epic/Cerner team)
4. **IRB protocol draft** (research team)
5. **Security requirements gathering** (security team)

**Week 1 deliverables:**
- Cloud environment provisioned
- EHR integration plan documented
- IRB protocol submitted
- Security checklist completed
- Sprint 1 planned (spatialtools completion)

---

## Conclusion

**Recommended Path:** Execute Phase 1-3 sequentially (12 weeks), then evaluate Phase 4 based on results.

**Critical Success Factor:** Do NOT skip infrastructure/security prerequisites. Patient data security is non-negotiable.

**Quick Win:** Focus on patient-one ovarian cancer use case end-to-end, rather than trying to make all servers production-ready simultaneously.
