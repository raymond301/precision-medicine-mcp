# Ethics & Bias Framework for Precision Medicine AI

This directory contains a comprehensive framework for detecting and mitigating algorithmic bias in precision medicine AI/ML workflows, aligned with FDA AI/ML SaMD guidance, AMA Code of Medical Ethics Opinion 2.3.2, and NIH All of Us diversity requirements.   
- **[ETHICS_AND_BIAS.md](ETHICS_AND_BIAS.md)** provides the complete methodology covering data representation analysis, fairness metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds, calibration), proxy feature detection, and ancestry-aware confidence scoring. 
- **[BIAS_AUDIT_CHECKLIST.md](BIAS_AUDIT_CHECKLIST.md)** offers a practical step-by-step guide for conducting quarterly audits (3-5 days per audit), while 
- **[PATIENTONE_BIAS_AUDIT.md](PATIENTONE_BIAS_AUDIT.md)** demonstrates the framework in action on a real ovarian cancer workflow, identifying 3 biases (BRCA databases Euro-centric, GTEx 85% European, generic cell references) with implemented mitigations achieving MEDIUM risk (acceptable for deployment). The framework includes automated bias detection tools (`shared/utils/bias_detection.py`, `scripts/audit/audit_bias.py`) and is integrated into hospital operations with quarterly auditing schedules, 10-year audit trail retention, and clear mitigation timelines (CRITICAL: blocking, HIGH: 1-2 weeks, MEDIUM: 1 month) to ensure equitable treatment recommendations across diverse patient populations and build trust in AI-powered clinical decision support.
