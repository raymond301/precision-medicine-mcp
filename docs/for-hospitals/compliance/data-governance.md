# Data Governance & Compliance

## Overview

This document establishes data governance policies for the Precision Medicine MCP servers. These policies ensure responsible handling of genomic, clinical, and multi-omics data in compliance with regulatory requirements and research ethics standards.

**Status:** ✅ Implemented (WI-7 from Risk Mitigation Workplan)  
**Risk Reduced:** R8 (Data governance and compliance) - 65% reduction (8/10 → 3/10)  

---

## Executive Summary

### Scope
This data governance framework applies to:
- **Genomic data** (FASTQ, VCF, BAM files)
- **Multi-omics data** (RNA-seq, proteomics, phosphoproteomics)
- **Spatial transcriptomics data** (10X Visium, MERFISH)
- **Imaging data** (H&E, immunofluorescence, multiplex imaging)
- **Clinical data** (patient demographics, treatment history, outcomes)

### Key Principles
1. **Research Use Only** - Not approved for clinical decision-making
2. **Patient Privacy** - De-identification and anonymization required
3. **Data Minimization** - Collect only necessary data
4. **Access Controls** - Role-based access to sensitive data
5. **Transparency** - Clear documentation of data handling
6. **Compliance** - Adherence to HIPAA, GDPR, and institutional policies

### Compliance Status

| Framework | Status | Documentation |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| HIPAA (US) | ✅ Compliant | **[See HIPAA Compliance Guide](hipaa.md)** |
| GDPR (EU) | ⚠️ Partial | See Section 1.1 below |

    def __init__(self, participant_id: str):
        self.participant_id = participant_id
        self.consent_date = None
        self.consent_version = None
        self.purposes = []
        self.withdrawals = []

    def grant_consent(self, purposes: List[str], version: str):
        """Record consent for specific purposes."""
        self.consent_date = datetime.now()
        self.consent_version = version
        self.purposes = purposes

    def withdraw_consent(self, reason: str = None):
        """Record consent withdrawal."""
        self.withdrawals.append({
            'date': datetime.now(),
            'reason': reason
        })

    def is_valid_for_purpose(self, purpose: str) -> bool:
        """Check if consent is valid for given purpose."""
        if self.withdrawals:
            return False
        return purpose in self.purposes
```

## 4. De-identification & Anonymization

### 4.1 De-identification Strategies

#### Safe Harbor Method (HIPAA)

**📚 For detailed HIPAA de-identification requirements, see: [HIPAA Compliance Guide](hipaa.md#de-identification-validation)**

Removes all 18 HIPAA identifiers.

**Pros:** Clear guidelines, no statistical analysis required
**Cons:** May lose utility (dates, geography)

#### Expert Determination Method (HIPAA)

Statistical expert certifies risk of re-identification is very small.

**Pros:** Retains more data utility
**Cons:** Requires expert analysis, documentation

#### K-Anonymity

Ensure each record is indistinguishable from at least k-1 other records based on quasi-identifiers.

**Example (k=3):**
```
Original:
Age | ZIP   | Diagnosis
35  | 02139 | Breast Cancer
36  | 02138 | Ovarian Cancer
37  | 02139 | Lung Cancer

K-Anonymous (k=3):
Age Range | ZIP (3-digit) | Diagnosis
35-40     | 021           | Breast Cancer
35-40     | 021           | Ovarian Cancer
35-40     | 021           | Lung Cancer
```

#### L-Diversity

Extension of k-anonymity ensuring diversity in sensitive attributes.

#### Differential Privacy

Add calibrated noise to query results to protect individual privacy while preserving aggregate statistics.

### 4.2 Genomic Data De-identification

**Challenges:**
- Genomic data is inherently identifying
- Cannot be truly anonymized (only de-identified)
- Risk of re-identification through genealogy databases, linkage attacks

**Best Practices:**

1. **Controlled Access** - Store in controlled-access repositories (dbGaP), require DUA
2. **Data Aggregation** - Share aggregate statistics instead of individual genotypes
3. **Beacon Attack Mitigation** - Avoid simple presence/absence queries, add noise
4. **Federated Analysis** - Compute on data without transferring, share only results

---

## 5. Data Retention & Deletion

### 5.1 Retention Periods

| Data Type | Minimum Retention | Maximum Retention | Authority |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Clinical trial data | 7 years after completion | 25 years | FDA 21 CFR 312.62 |
| NIH-funded research data | 7 years after final report | No limit | NIH Grants Policy |
| Published research data | Duration of publication | No limit | Journal policies |
| Participant consent forms | 7 years after study end | Permanent | IRB requirements |
| Human genomic data | 7 years (minimum) | No limit | NIH GDS Policy |
| Patient medical records | State-dependent (5-10 years) | Permanent | State law |

### 5.2 Secure Deletion

**When retention period expires:**

1. **Verify Authorization** - Confirm period expired, obtain PI/IRB approval
2. **Deletion Procedure**
   ```bash
   # Secure file deletion
   shred -vfz -n 3 sensitive_file.csv
   ```
3. **Multi-Copy Deletion** - Delete all copies (primary, backups, archives, local)
4. **Documentation** - Record deletion date, authorization, what was deleted

**Secure Media Disposal:**
- Hard drives: Physical destruction or DoD 5220.22-M wipe (7 passes)
- SSDs: ATA Secure Erase or physical destruction
- USB drives: Physical destruction
- CDs/DVDs: Physical shredding
- Paper records: Cross-cut shredding or incineration
