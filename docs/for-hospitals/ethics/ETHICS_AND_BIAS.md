## Introduction

### Why Ethics & Bias Matter in Precision Medicine

**Trust is the primary barrier to clinical AI adoption.** While AI-driven precision medicine promises personalized treatment recommendations, algorithmic bias threatens to exacerbate health disparities across ancestral populations and socioeconomic groups.

This framework provides systematic methods to:
- **Detect bias** across genomics, spatial transcriptomics, multiomics, and clinical data
- **Document findings** with transparency about limitations
- **Mitigate bias** through diverse reference datasets and fairness-aware approaches
- **Build trust** by demonstrating rigorous ethical AI practices

### The Stakes

**Genomics Bias:** Variant interpretation databases are predominantly Euro-centric. A pathogenic variant classified in European populations may have uncertain significance in African, Latino, or Asian ancestries, potentially leading to:
- Missed diagnoses (false negatives)
- Inappropriate treatments (false positives)
- Genetic counseling gaps

**Clinical Bias:** Treatment recommendations influenced by insurance status, zip code, or inappropriate use of race as a biological proxy can perpetuate systemic health inequities.

**Spatial & Multiomics Bias:** Reference cell type signatures and pathway databases may not generalize across diverse populations, affecting deconvolution accuracy and therapeutic target predictions.

### Relationship to HIPAA Compliance

This ethics framework **complements** existing HIPAA compliance (see [../compliance/hipaa.md](../compliance/hipaa.md)):

- **HIPAA:** Protects patient privacy through de-identification and access controls
- **Ethics & Bias:** Ensures AI recommendations are **fair and equitable** across populations
- **Shared Goal:** Patient safety and trust in healthcare AI

Bias auditing does NOT require re-identification of patients. All audits use de-identified aggregate statistics stratified by ancestry or socioeconomic indicators (where ethically appropriate).

### Legal & Regulatory Landscape

**US healthcare AI is subject to:**
- **FDA regulation** for software as a medical device (SaMD)
- **HIPAA Privacy Rule** for patient data protection
- **21st Century Cures Act** mandating health equity through technology
- **AMA ethical guidelines** for physician use of AI
- **State laws** (e.g., California AI transparency requirements)

Demonstrating bias mitigation is increasingly **required** for:
- FDA pre-market approval of AI/ML devices
- Hospital procurement of AI tools
- Medical malpractice liability reduction
- Research publication in high-impact journals

### Key Principles

1. **Diversity:** Use reference datasets representing diverse ancestral populations
2. **Transparency:** Document ancestry distributions of all reference data
3. **Fairness:** Validate equal performance across demographic subgroups
4. **Accountability:** Maintain audit logs and bias reports for compliance
5. **Continuous Monitoring:** Quarterly audits to detect bias drift over time

### 5. AMA Code of Medical Ethics Opinion 2.3.2

**Source:** American Medical Association (2018)

**Physicians' Responsibilities for AI:**
1. **Understand the AI tool:** Know how it was trained, on what data, with what limitations
2. **Maintain oversight:** AI is decision support, not replacement for clinical judgment
3. **Ensure equity:** Verify AI performs equitably across patient populations
4. **Disclose to patients:** Inform patients when AI is used in their care
5. **Monitor outcomes:** Track AI performance in clinical practice

**Relevance to Precision Medicine:**
- **Equity (Responsibility 3):** Physicians must verify bias audits before using AI tools
- **Understanding (Responsibility 1):** Clinicians should know if reference data is Euro-centric
- **Disclosure (Responsibility 4):** Patients have right to know AI limitations

**Compliance Strategy:**
- Provide clinicians with bias audit summaries

### 6. HIPAA Privacy Rule and Algorithmic Fairness

**Source:** HHS Office for Civil Rights

**Intersection with Bias:**
- **De-identification (§164.514):** Bias audits use aggregate statistics, no PHI exposure
- **Minimum necessary (§164.502):** Use ancestry/ethnicity ONLY when clinically justified (e.g., genomic interpretation)
- **Non-discrimination:** HIPAA prohibits discrimination, bias audits support compliance

**Ethical Use of Ancestry/Ethnicity Data:**
- ✅ **Appropriate:** Ancestry for genomic variant interpretation (genetic, not social construct)
- ❌ **Inappropriate:** Race as proxy for biology (e.g., assuming kidney function differs by race)
- ✅ **Appropriate:** Socioeconomic ZIP code for resource access (not treatment eligibility)
- ❌ **Inappropriate:** Insurance status influencing clinical recommendations

**Compliance Strategy:**
- Audit trail: Document why ancestry was used (genomic context)
- Prohibit demographic proxies in algorithmic decisions
- Annual review of feature usage

## Types of Bias in Precision Medicine

### Overview

Bias can enter precision medicine workflows at multiple stages:
1. **Data Collection:** Who is included in reference datasets?
2. **Feature Selection:** Are demographic proxies used inappropriately?
3. **Model Training:** Does the algorithm learn spurious correlations?
4. **Clinical Interpretation:** Do clinicians over-rely on biased AI recommendations?

### 1. Data Bias

#### A. Representation Bias

**Definition:** Training/reference data over-represents certain populations, under-represents others.

**Examples in Precision Medicine:**
- **GTEx:** 85% European ancestry → Gene expression reference ranges may not generalize
- **ClinVar:** Predominantly European variant classifications → Pathogenicity uncertain in other ancestries
- **Clinical trials:** Historically <5% non-White participants → Drug efficacy unknown in diverse populations

**Detection:**
- Calculate demographic distribution of reference datasets
- Compare to US population (60% White, 18% Hispanic, 13% Black, 6% Asian)
- Flag datasets with <10% representation for any major group

**Mitigation:**
- Use diverse datasets (gnomAD: 43% European, 21% African, 14% Latino)
- Cross-validate with All of Us (80% underrepresented groups)
- Apply larger uncertainty margins for underrepresented groups

---

#### B. Selection Bias

**Definition:** Systematic exclusion of certain populations from data collection.

**Examples:**
- **Geographic bias:** Databases from academic medical centers → Miss rural/underserved populations
- **Language bias:** English-only consent forms → Exclude non-English speakers
- **Digital divide:** Online recruitment → Miss low-income patients without internet

**Detection:**
- Review data source inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Check geographic distribution (urban vs. rural)
- Analyze socioeconomic indicators (if available)

**Mitigation:**
- Use community-based recruitment (All of Us model)
- Provide multilingual materials
- Offer in-person enrollment options

---

#### C. Measurement Bias

**Definition:** Data collection methods introduce systematic errors across groups.

**Examples:**
- **Sequencing coverage:** Lower quality for GC-rich regions → Affects certain ancestries differently
- **Clinical coding:** Race/ethnicity miscoded in EHRs (self-report vs. administrative assignment)
- **Imaging artifacts:** Skin tone affects optical imaging quality

**Detection:**
- Stratify quality control metrics by ancestry
- Compare self-reported vs. administratively assigned demographics
- Validate imaging protocols across skin tones

**Mitigation:**
- Use uniform sequencing protocols
- Implement self-reported demographics in FHIR (US Core)
- Calibrate imaging equipment for diverse skin tones

---

### 2. Algorithmic Bias

#### A. Model Training Bias

**Definition:** Machine learning models trained on biased data learn to perpetuate bias.

**Examples:**
- **Label bias:** If "high-risk" labels were historically assigned more to certain groups, model learns this pattern
- **Proxy learning:** Model uses ZIP code as proxy for socioeconomic status, leading to disparate treatment
- **Sample size imbalance:** Model optimizes for majority group, underperforms on minority groups

**Detection:**
- Calculate fairness metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds) by group
- Identify proxy features (ZIP code, language, insurance) with high feature importance
- Test model performance stratified by ancestry/ethnicity

**Mitigation:**
- Fairness-aware training (constrain model to equal performance across groups)
- Remove proxy features from input
- Oversample underrepresented groups during training

---

#### B. Feature Selection Bias

**Definition:** Inappropriate features encode demographic information.

**Examples:**
- **ZIP code:** Proxy for race/socioeconomic status
- **Language preference:** Proxy for immigrant status, education
- **Insurance type:** Proxy for income, employment

**Detection:**
- Audit all input features
- Flag features correlated with protected attributes (r > 0.5)
- Test model performance with/without proxy features

**Mitigation:**
- Exclude demographic proxies from clinical decision algorithms
- Use proxies only for resource allocation (e.g., language preference for interpretation services)
- Document rationale for any demographic feature use

---

### 3. Interpretation Bias

#### A. Confirmation Bias

**Definition:** Clinicians over-rely on AI recommendations, especially when they confirm pre-existing beliefs.

**Examples:**
- Accepting Euro-centric variant interpretation without seeking ancestry-specific data
- Trusting treatment recommendations that align with institutional norms
- Dismissing patient concerns when AI suggests low risk

**Detection:**
- Survey clinicians on AI usage patterns
- Track override rates (do clinicians modify AI recommendations?)
- Analyze outcomes stratified by AI agreement

**Mitigation:**
- Require clinical justification when accepting high-uncertainty AI recommendations
- Display confidence intervals and ancestry caveats prominently
- Train clinicians on AI limitations

---

#### B. Automation Bias

**Definition:** Over-reliance on automated systems, reduced critical thinking.

**Examples:**
- Not seeking genetic counseling for variants with limited ancestry data
- Accepting treatment recommendations without considering patient preferences
- Missing errors in AI-generated reports

**Detection:**
- Audit time spent reviewing AI recommendations
- Track patient satisfaction with AI-assisted care
- Compare outcomes: AI-assisted vs. manual clinical decisions

**Mitigation:**
- Require explicit clinician sign-off on AI recommendations
- Implement alerts for high-uncertainty cases
- Regular training on AI limitations and failure modes

---

### 4. Specific Biases in Precision Medicine Modalities

#### A. Genomics Bias

**Ancestry-specific challenges:**
- **Variant interpretation:** ClinVar/COSMIC predominantly European
- **Allele frequencies:** Population-specific (gnomAD essential)
- **Structural variants:** Large deletions/duplications vary by ancestry
- **Pharmacogenomics:** Drug metabolism alleles differ across populations

**Example:**
- BRCA1 c.5266dupC: Well-studied in European Ashkenazi Jews, limited data in other ancestries
- Result: May be called pathogenic in Europeans, VUS (variant of uncertain significance) in others

**Mitigation:**
- Always check gnomAD for population-specific allele frequencies
- Flag variants with <5 studies in patient's ancestry
- Recommend genetic counseling for VUS in underrepresented ancestries

---

#### B. Spatial Transcriptomics Bias

**Reference-dependent challenges:**
- **Cell type signatures:** If references are from European donors, deconvolution may misclassify cell types in other ancestries
- **Gene expression ranges:** Baseline expression varies across populations
- **Tissue architecture:** Histological patterns may differ by ancestry (e.g., immune cell infiltration)

**Example:**
- Using European pancreatic islet references to deconvolve Asian patient spatial data
- Result: Misidentified cell types, incorrect spatial patterns

**Mitigation:**
- Use diverse references (Human Cell Atlas)
- Document reference ancestry distribution
- Cross-validate with histology (H&E pathology review)

---

#### C. Multiomics Bias

**Integration challenges:**
- **PDX models:** Are xenografts representative of patient populations?
- **Pathway databases:** KEGG/Reactome based on aggregate human data, not stratified by ancestry
- **Drug response:** Clinical trials predominantly European → Efficacy unknown in other groups

**Example:**
- Predicting kinase inhibitor response using European PDX models
- Result: May not generalize to Asian patients with different tumor biology

**Mitigation:**
- Use diverse PDX cohorts when available
- Cross-validate pathway enrichment across multiple databases
- Reference All of Us for drug-gene interaction validation

---

#### D. Clinical Data Bias (FHIR)

**Socioeconomic proxies:**
- **Insurance status:** Should NEVER influence treatment recommendations
- **ZIP code:** Appropriate for resource access (clinics, pharmacies), NOT for clinical decisions
- **Race/ethnicity:** Appropriate for genomics (ancestry), NOT as biological proxy

**Example:**
- Algorithm recommends less aggressive treatment for Medicaid patients
- Result: Health equity violation, potential legal liability

**Mitigation:**
- Remove insurance status from clinical decision algorithms
- Audit for proxy features (language, address, race used inappropriately)
- Use race/ethnicity ONLY for genomic variant interpretation

---

## Bias Audit Methodology

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Data Representation Analysis

**Objective:** Determine if reference datasets represent diverse populations.

**Actions:**
1. **Inventory all reference datasets:**
   - Genomics: ClinVar, COSMIC, gnomAD, GTEx, etc.
   - Spatial: SingleR references, Human Cell Atlas
   - Clinical: MIMIC-IV, local EHR data

2. **Extract ancestry distributions:**
   - For each dataset, document % European, African, Latino, Asian, Other
   - Compare to US population (baseline: 60% White, 18% Hispanic, 13% Black, 6% Asian)

3. **Flag underrepresentation:**
   - Datasets with <10% representation for any major group = HIGH RISK
   - Datasets with <5% = CRITICAL RISK, recommend alternative

4. **Document findings:**
   - Create table: Dataset | European % | African % | Latino % | Asian % | Other % | Risk Level
   - Example:
     ```
     Dataset      | European | African | Latino | Asian | Risk Level
     --------------|----------|---------|--------|-------|------------
     GTEx          | 85%      | 10%     | 5%     | 0%    | HIGH (Asian)
     gnomAD        | 43%      | 21%     | 14%    | 9%    | LOW
     ClinVar       | ~70%     | ~10%    | ~10%   | ~5%   | MEDIUM
     All of Us     | 40%      | 25%     | 20%    | 8%    | LOW
     ```

**Deliverable:** Reference Dataset Diversity Report

---

#### Step 2: Algorithm Fairness Testing

**Objective:** Validate equal performance across demographic subgroups.

**Actions:**
1. **Stratify test data by demographics:**
   - Ancestry/ethnicity (from FHIR or self-report)
   - Socioeconomic indicators (if ethically appropriate: education, income)
   - Geographic location (urban vs. rural)

2. **Calculate performance metrics per group:**
   - Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV
   - For continuous outcomes: RMSE, MAE
   - For rankings: AUC-ROC

3. **Test for statistically significant disparities:**
   - Use chi-square or t-test to compare metrics across groups
   - Flag disparities >10% as requiring mitigation
   - Example:
     ```
     Group      | Accuracy | Sensitivity | Specificity | Disparity
     -----------|----------|-------------|-------------|----------
     European   | 92%      | 90%         | 94%         | --
     African    | 85%      | 80%         | 90%         | -7% ⚠️
     Latino     | 88%      | 85%         | 91%         | -4%
     Asian      | 82%      | 75%         | 89%         | -10% ⚠️⚠️
     ```

4. **Calculate fairness metrics:**
   - Demographic parity: P(ŷ=1|A=a) equal across groups
   - Equalized odds: P(ŷ=1|Y=y,A=a) equal across groups
   - Calibration: P(Y=1|ŷ=p,A=a) equal across groups

**Deliverable:** Algorithm Fairness Test Results

---

#### Step 3: Output Stratification Analysis

**Objective:** Detect bias in final recommendations.

**Actions:**
1. **Stratify treatment recommendations by demographics:**
   - Count aggressive vs. conservative treatments by ancestry
   - Example:
     ```
     Treatment      | European (n=100) | African (n=50) | Latino (n=50)
     ---------------|------------------|----------------|---------------
     Aggressive     | 45 (45%)         | 18 (36%)       | 20 (40%)
     Conservative   | 55 (55%)         | 32 (64%)       | 30 (60%)
     ```
   - Chi-square test: p = 0.03 → Statistically significant disparity

2. **Analyze confidence scores by group:**
   - Do certain groups get lower confidence scores?
   - Lower confidence → May indicate limited reference data
   - Example:
     ```
     Group      | Mean Confidence | SD    | Flag
     -----------|-----------------|-------|-----
     European   | 0.92            | 0.08  | --
     African    | 0.78            | 0.15  | ⚠️ (14% lower)
     Latino     | 0.85            | 0.12  | --
     Asian      | 0.70            | 0.18  | ⚠️⚠️ (22% lower)
     ```

3. **Check for proxy feature influence:**
   - Run model with/without ZIP code, insurance, language
   - If performance changes >5%, proxy features are influential (bad)

**Deliverable:** Output Disparity Analysis

---

#### Step 4: Clinical Validation

**Objective:** Expert review to contextualize statistical findings.

**Actions:**
1. **Assemble review panel:**
   - Medical geneticist (genomics bias)
   - Oncologist (treatment recommendations)
   - Bioinformatician (technical validation)
   - Bioethicist (fairness assessment)

2. **Present audit findings:**
   - Data representation gaps
   - Algorithmic disparities
   - Output stratification results

3. **Expert assessment:**
   - Are disparities clinically meaningful?
   - Are mitigations feasible?
   - Are limitations acceptable for clinical use?

4. **Generate recommendations:**
   - Go/No-Go decision for production deployment
   - Mitigation requirements
   - Monitoring plan

**Deliverable:** Clinical Validation Report

---

### Audit Frequency

**Initial Audit:** Before production deployment (comprehensive)

**Quarterly Audits:** Every 3 months (abbreviated)
- Re-check fairness metrics on new data
- Validate no bias drift over time
- Update reference dataset versions

**Triggered Audits:** After workflow changes
- New reference dataset added
- Algorithm updated
- Bias incident reported
- Regulatory request

**Annual Comprehensive Audit:** Full re-audit (all 4 steps)

---

## Fairness Metrics

### 1. Demographic Parity

**Definition:** Algorithm makes positive predictions at equal rates across groups.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
P(ŷ = 1 | A = a) = P(ŷ = 1 | A = b)  for all groups a, b
```

**Example (Treatment Recommendations):**
```
Group      | Total Patients | Aggressive Treatment | Rate
-----------|----------------|----------------------|------
European   | 100            | 45                   | 45%
African    | 50             | 18                   | 36%
Latino     | 50             | 20                   | 40%
```
**Violation:** African patients receive aggressive treatment at lower rate (36% vs. 45%).

**When to Use:**
- Screening/triage decisions (equal opportunity to advance)
- Resource allocation (equal access)

**When NOT to Use:**
- If base rates differ by group (e.g., disease prevalence varies)
- May enforce quotas, violating individual fairness

**Python Implementation:**
```python
def demographic_parity(y_pred, groups):
    """Calculate demographic parity disparity."""
    parity = {}
    for group in np.unique(groups):
        mask = groups == group
        parity[group] = y_pred[mask].mean()

    max_disparity = max(parity.values()) - min(parity.values())
    return parity, max_disparity
```

---

### 2. Equalized Odds

**Definition:** Algorithm has equal true positive rate (sensitivity) and false positive rate across groups.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
P(ŷ = 1 | Y = 1, A = a) = P(ŷ = 1 | Y = 1, A = b)  [Equal TPR]
P(ŷ = 1 | Y = 0, A = a) = P(ŷ = 1 | Y = 0, A = b)  [Equal FPR]
```

**Example (Cancer Detection):**
```
Group      | Sensitivity (TPR) | Specificity (1-FPR)
-----------|-------------------|--------------------
European   | 90%               | 94%
African    | 80%               | 90%
```
**Violation:** African patients have 10% lower sensitivity (more false negatives).

**When to Use:**
- Diagnostic algorithms (equal accuracy)
- Treatment response prediction (equal benefit)

**When NOT to Use:**
- If we care more about one error type (e.g., false negatives worse than false positives)

**Python Implementation:**
```python
def equalized_odds(y_true, y_pred, groups):
    """Calculate equalized odds metrics."""
    results = {}
    for group in np.unique(groups):
        mask = groups == group
        y_t, y_p = y_true[mask], y_pred[mask]

        tpr = ((y_p == 1) & (y_t == 1)).sum() / (y_t == 1).sum()  # Sensitivity
        fpr = ((y_p == 1) & (y_t == 0)).sum() / (y_t == 0).sum()

        results[group] = {'tpr': tpr, 'fpr': fpr}

    return results
```

---

### 3. Calibration

**Definition:** Predicted probabilities match observed frequencies across groups.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
P(Y = 1 | ŷ = p, A = a) ≈ p  for all groups a and probabilities p
```

**Example (Risk Prediction):**
```
Group      | Predicted Risk 80% | Observed Outcome
-----------|--------------------|-----------------
European   | 100 patients       | 78% actually high-risk
African    | 50 patients        | 60% actually high-risk
```
**Violation:** Model over-predicts risk for African patients (says 80%, reality 60%).

**When to Use:**
- Probability-based decisions (surgery risk, drug efficacy)
- Patient communication (need accurate probabilities)

**When NOT to Use:**
- Binary classifications (no probabilities)
- Ranking tasks (relative order matters, not absolute probabilities)

**Python Implementation:**
```python
def calibration_by_group(y_true, y_prob, groups, n_bins=10):
    """Calculate calibration stratified by group."""
    results = {}
    for group in np.unique(groups):
        mask = groups == group
        y_t, y_p = y_true[mask], y_prob[mask]

        bins = np.linspace(0, 1, n_bins + 1)
        bin_centers = (bins[:-1] + bins[1:]) / 2

        observed_freq = []
        for i in range(n_bins):
            in_bin = (y_p >= bins[i]) & (y_p < bins[i+1])
            if in_bin.sum() > 0:
                observed_freq.append(y_t[in_bin].mean())
            else:
                observed_freq.append(np.nan)

        results[group] = {'predicted': bin_centers, 'observed': observed_freq}

    return results
```

---

### 4. Clinical Utility Parity

**Definition:** Algorithm provides equal clinical benefit (lives saved, QALYs gained) across groups.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
Expected Benefit(A = a) ≈ Expected Benefit(A = b)
```

**Example (Treatment Selection):**
```
Group      | Optimal Treatment | Sub-optimal Treatment | Benefit Lost
-----------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------
European   | 90%               | 10%                   | 0.5 QALYs
African    | 75%               | 25%                   | 1.2 QALYs
```
**Violation:** African patients lose 2.4x more QALYs due to sub-optimal recommendations.

**When to Use:**
- Ultimate fairness metric (focuses on outcomes, not predictions)
- Justifying clinical deployment

**Challenges:**
- Requires long-term outcome data
- Hard to estimate counterfactual (what if different treatment chosen?)

---

### Choosing the Right Metric

**Scenario:** Cancer screening algorithm

**Considerations:**
1. **Goal:** Detect cancer early (maximize TPR)
2. **Harm:** False negatives (missed cancer) worse than false positives (unnecessary biopsy)
3. **Metric:** Equalized odds with emphasis on equal TPR (sensitivity)

**Scenario:** Treatment recommendation system

**Considerations:**
1. **Goal:** Select best treatment for individual patient
2. **Harm:** Incorrect treatment (toxicity or inefficacy)
3. **Metric:** Calibration (need accurate probabilities) + clinical utility parity (equal benefit)

**General Guidance:**
- Use **multiple metrics** (no single metric captures all fairness)
- **Prioritize clinical utility parity** when outcome data available
- **Document trade-offs** (some metrics conflict, e.g., demographic parity vs. individual fairness)

---

## Transparency & Explainability

### 1. Model Explainability

**Goal:** Enable clinicians to understand WHY the AI made a recommendation.

**Methods:**

#### A. Feature Importance (Global Explainability)

**SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):**
- Shows contribution of each feature to model predictions
- Aggregates across all patients to show global patterns

**Example:**
```
Feature                | SHAP Value | Importance
-----------------------|------------|------------
BRCA1 mutation status  | +0.45      | High
CA-125 level           | +0.32      | High
Patient age            | +0.18      | Medium
Treatment history      | +0.15      | Medium
ZIP code               | +0.03      | Low ⚠️ (should be 0)
```

**Red Flag:** ZIP code has non-zero importance → Possible socioeconomic proxy

**Python Implementation:**
```python
import shap

explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test)

# Global feature importance
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test, plot_type="bar")
```

---

#### B. Instance-Level Explanations (Local Explainability)

**SHAP Force Plot:**
- Shows how each feature contributed to THIS patient's prediction

**Example (PatientOne):**
```
Baseline prediction: 50% risk
+ BRCA1 mutation: +25%
+ CA-125 elevated: +15%
+ Stage IV: +10%
- Age 63 (not elderly): -5%
= Final prediction: 95% high-risk
```

**Clinical Use:**
- Displays to clinician alongside recommendation
- Enables validation ("Does this make clinical sense?")
- Reveals potential errors ("Why is ZIP code contributing?")

---

### 2. Decision Provenance (Audit Trails)

**Goal:** Record complete chain of reasoning for every AI recommendation.

**Required Information:**
1. **Timestamp:** When recommendation was generated
2. **Model version:** Which algorithm version was used
3. **Input data:** Patient features, reference datasets
4. **Output:** Prediction, confidence score, explanation
5. **Reference data versions:** ClinVar 2025-01, gnomAD v4.1, etc.
6. **Ancestry context:** Patient self-reported ancestry, reference data ancestry distribution

**Example Audit Log:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-01-12T14:30:00Z",
  "patient_id": "PAT001-deidentified",
  "model": "variant-interpreter-v2.3",
  "input": {
    "variant": "BRCA1 c.5266dupC",
    "ancestry": "European",
    "clinical_history": "family_history_breast_cancer"
  },
  "references": {
    "clinvar": "2025-01",
    "gnomad": "v4.1",
    "clinvar_ancestry_distribution": {
      "european": 0.70,
      "african": 0.10,
      "latino": 0.10,
      "asian": 0.05,
      "other": 0.05
    }
  },
  "output": {
    "classification": "pathogenic",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "explanation": "Well-studied in European populations, 50+ pathogenicity assertions"
  },
  "warnings": [
    "Limited data in non-European ancestries (<5 studies)"
  ]
}
```

**Compliance:**
- Store for 10 years (HIPAA alignment)
- Enable reconstruction of decision ("Why was this patient classified pathogenic?")
- Support external audits (FDA, hospital quality assurance)

---

### 3. Uncertainty Quantification

**Goal:** Communicate confidence in predictions, especially when limited data.

**Methods:**

#### A. Confidence Intervals

**Example (Risk Prediction):**
```
Predicted 5-year survival: 65% (95% CI: 55%-75%)
```

**Interpretation:**
- Wide interval → High uncertainty → Consider additional testing
- Narrow interval → High confidence → Proceed with treatment plan

---

#### B. Ancestry-Specific Uncertainty

**Example (Variant Interpretation):**
```
Patient Ancestry: African
Variant: BRCA1 c.5266dupC

Classification: Likely Pathogenic
Confidence: MEDIUM

European data: 50+ studies (HIGH confidence)
African data: 2 studies (LOW confidence)

⚠️ Recommendation: Genetic counseling advised due to limited ancestral data
```

**Clinical Impact:**
- Prevents over-confidence in predictions for underrepresented groups
- Triggers additional validation (genetic counseling, functional studies)

---

### 4. Disclaimers and Limitations

**Required Disclosures:**

#### A. In Reports to Clinicians

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                      ⚠️ IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS ⚠️
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Reference Data Ancestry Distribution:
  • ClinVar: 70% European, 10% African, 10% Latino, 5% Asian, 5% Other
  • GTEx:   85% European, 10% African, 5% Other (NO Asian representation)

Patient Ancestry: Asian

⚠️ CAUTION: Gene expression reference ranges (GTEx) have NO Asian
representation. Results may not accurately reflect normal variation
in this patient's ancestry.

Recommendation: Validate differential expression findings with
ancestry-matched references (Human Cell Atlas) or apply larger
fold-change thresholds (log2FC > 2.0 instead of 1.5).
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

#### B. In Patient-Facing Summaries

```
Your genomic analysis was performed using reference databases that
primarily include individuals of European ancestry. While the analysis
is clinically valid, findings may have greater uncertainty for
individuals of non-European ancestry. Your healthcare provider will
discuss these limitations with you.

For more information on genomic diversity, visit: https://allofus.nih.gov/
```

---

## Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Use Diverse Reference Datasets

**Problem:** Reference data is Euro-centric, leading to poor performance in other ancestries.

**Solution:** Use diverse datasets (see Section 8 for specific recommendations).

**Implementation:**
```python
# BEFORE: Euro-centric reference
reference = load_gtex_reference()  # 85% European

# AFTER: Diverse reference
reference = merge_references([
    load_gtex_reference(),      # 85% European (948 donors)
    load_topmed_reference(),    # Diverse US population (180K genomes)
    load_human_cell_atlas()     # Global diversity (single-cell)
])
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce performance disparity across ancestries by 30-50%
- Increase confidence in predictions for underrepresented groups

---

### 2. Flag High-Uncertainty Predictions

**Problem:** AI provides confident predictions even when data is limited.

**Solution:** Implement ancestry-aware confidence scoring.

**Implementation:**
```python
def calculate_confidence(variant, patient_ancestry, reference_db):
    """Calculate confidence with ancestry context."""

    # Base confidence from model
    base_confidence = model.predict_proba(variant)

    # Adjust based on ancestral data availability
    ancestral_studies = reference_db.count_studies(variant, patient_ancestry)

    if ancestral_studies < 5:
        confidence_penalty = 0.3  # Reduce confidence by 30%
    elif ancestral_studies < 20:
        confidence_penalty = 0.1
    else:
        confidence_penalty = 0.0

    adjusted_confidence = base_confidence * (1 - confidence_penalty)

    warnings = []
    if ancestral_studies < 5:
        warnings.append(f"Limited data in {patient_ancestry} ancestry (<5 studies)")

    return {
        'confidence': adjusted_confidence,
        'warnings': warnings,
        'ancestral_studies': ancestral_studies
    }
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Prevent over-confidence for underrepresented groups
- Trigger appropriate clinical follow-up (genetic counseling)

---

### 3. Remove Demographic Proxy Features

**Problem:** Algorithm uses ZIP code, insurance, or language as proxies for demographics.

**Solution:** Audit feature importance, remove proxies from clinical decision algorithms.

**Implementation:**
```python
# Define demographic proxies
PROXY_FEATURES = ['zip_code', 'insurance_type', 'language_preference', 'census_tract']

# Audit feature importance
feature_importance = model.feature_importances_
proxy_importance = {f: importance for f, importance in feature_importance.items()
                   if f in PROXY_FEATURES}

# Flag high-importance proxies
flagged = {f: imp for f, imp in proxy_importance.items() if imp > 0.05}

if flagged:
    print("⚠️ WARNING: Demographic proxies have high feature importance:")
    for feature, importance in flagged.items():
        print(f"  {feature}: {importance:.3f}")

    # Remove proxies and retrain
    X_train_filtered = X_train.drop(columns=PROXY_FEATURES)
    model.fit(X_train_filtered, y_train)
```

**Allowed Uses of Proxies:**
- ZIP code for resource allocation (finding nearest clinic)
- Language preference for interpretation services
- Insurance type for billing (NOT for clinical decisions)

---

### 4. Fairness-Aware Training

**Problem:** Standard ML training optimizes overall accuracy, ignoring disparities.

**Solution:** Add fairness constraints during training.

**Implementation (Demographic Parity Constraint):**
```python
from fairlearn.reductions import ExponentiatedGradient, DemographicParity

# Standard training (no fairness constraint)
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Fairness-aware training
mitigator = ExponentiatedGradient(
    estimator=LogisticRegression(),
    constraints=DemographicParity()
)
mitigator.fit(X_train, y_train, sensitive_features=ancestry_labels)

# Result: Equal prediction rates across ancestries
```

**Trade-off:**
- Slight reduction in overall accuracy (1-3%)
- Significant improvement in fairness (20-40% disparity reduction)

---

### 5. Post-hoc Calibration

**Problem:** Model is miscalibrated for certain groups (over/under-predicts risk).

**Solution:** Apply group-specific calibration.

**Implementation:**
```python
from sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV

# Train base model
base_model = RandomForestClassifier()
base_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Calibrate separately for each ancestry group
calibrated_models = {}
for ancestry in ['european', 'african', 'latino', 'asian']:
    mask = ancestry_labels == ancestry
    X_cal, y_cal = X_calib[mask], y_calib[mask]

    calibrated_models[ancestry] = CalibratedClassifierCV(
        base_model, method='isotonic', cv='prefit'
    )
    calibrated_models[ancestry].fit(X_cal, y_cal)

# At prediction time, use ancestry-specific calibrated model
def predict_calibrated(X, ancestry):
    return calibrated_models[ancestry].predict_proba(X)
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Improve calibration by 15-30%
- Accurate probabilities enable better clinical decision-making

---

### 6. Human-in-the-Loop Validation

**Problem:** Automated bias detection may miss nuanced clinical issues.

**Solution:** Expert review of flagged cases.

**Implementation:**
1. **Automated flagging:**
   - Low confidence predictions
   - High-uncertainty ancestries
   - Divergent recommendations (AI vs. clinical guidelines)

2. **Expert panel review:**
   - Monthly review of flagged cases
   - Panel: geneticist, oncologist, bioethicist

3. **Feedback loop:**
   - Experts annotate cases (agree/disagree with AI)
   - Use annotations to improve model

**Expected Impact:**
- Catch edge cases missed by automated audits
- Build institutional trust in AI system

```

---

### Best Practices for Using Diverse Datasets

#### 1. Multi-Dataset Cross-Validation

**Strategy:** Never rely on a single reference dataset.

**Example:**
```python
def interpret_variant_with_multiple_refs(variant, ancestry):
    """Cross-validate variant interpretation across datasets."""

    results = {
        'clinvar': query_clinvar(variant),
        'gnomad': query_gnomad(variant, ancestry),
        'clingen': query_clingen(variant),
        'all_of_us': query_all_of_us(variant, ancestry)
    }

    # Check for consensus
    classifications = [r['classification'] for r in results.values()]

    if len(set(classifications)) == 1:
        return f"✅ Consensus: {classifications[0]}"
    else:
        return f"⚠️ Discrepancy: {classifications}. Manual review required."
```

---

#### 2. Document Ancestry Distributions

**Requirement:** Every report must disclose reference data ancestry composition.

**Template:**
```markdown
## Reference Data Ancestry Distributions

| Dataset | European | African | Latino | Asian | Other | Source |
|---------|----------|---------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| ClinVar | 70%      | 10%     | 10%    | 5%    | 5%    | Estimated |
| gnomAD  | 43%      | 21%     | 14%    | 9%    | 8%    | Published |
| GTEx    | 85%      | 10%     | 0%     | 0%    | 5%    | Published |

**Patient Ancestry:** African

**⚠️ Limitations:**
- ClinVar and GTEx have limited African representation
- GTEx has NO Asian representation
- Findings should be validated with gnomAD (21% African) and All of Us (25% African American)
```

---

#### 3. Flag Underrepresented Patient Ancestries

**Automated Check:**
```python
def check_representation(patient_ancestry, reference_datasets):
    """Flag if patient ancestry is underrepresented."""

    warnings = []

    for dataset, ancestry_dist in reference_datasets.items():
        patient_representation = ancestry_dist.get(patient_ancestry, 0)

        if patient_representation < 0.05:  # <5% representation
            warnings.append(
                f"⚠️ CRITICAL: {dataset} has <5% {patient_ancestry} representation "
                f"({patient_representation:.1%}). Results may be unreliable."
            )
        elif patient_representation < 0.10:  # <10% representation
            warnings.append(
                f"⚠️ CAUTION: {dataset} has limited {patient_ancestry} representation "
                f"({patient_representation:.1%}). Validate with diverse references."
            )

    return warnings
```

---

#### 4. Update References Annually

**Strategy:** Reference datasets are continuously updated with new diverse samples.

**Update Schedule:**
- **gnomAD:** Check for updates quarterly (v4.1 → v4.2, etc.)
- **ClinVar:** Monthly updates
- **GTEx:** Updates less frequent (v8 → v9 every 2-3 years)
- **All of Us:** Quarterly releases as enrollment grows

**Documentation:**
```yaml
# reference_versions.yaml
last_updated: 2026-01-12

datasets:
  gnomad:
    version: v4.1
    release_date: 2024-10-15
    next_check: 2026-04-01

  clinvar:
    version: 2026-01
    release_date: 2026-01-01
    next_check: 2026-02-01

  gtex:
    version: v8
    release_date: 2020-09-01
    next_check: 2026-06-01  # Check if v9 released
```

## Batch Bias Auditing Approach

### Manual Execution Model

**Philosophy:** Start with manual quarterly audits. Automation can be added later if needed.

**Advantages:**
- Human oversight catches nuanced issues
- Flexible (can adapt methodology between audits)
- Lower initial development cost
- Clinical team learns about bias through hands-on auditing

**Disadvantages:**
- Labor-intensive (4-8 hours per audit)
- Requires trained personnel
- May miss real-time bias incidents

**Decision:** Manual execution is appropriate for initial deployment. Reassess after 4 audits (1 year).

---

### Audit Schedule

#### Initial Audit (Before Production Deployment)

**Scope:** Comprehensive (all 4 steps)
- Step 1: Data representation analysis
- Step 2: Algorithm fairness testing
- Step 3: Output stratification analysis
- Step 4: Clinical validation

**Timeline:** 2 weeks
- Week 1: Data collection and analysis (Steps 1-3)
- Week 2: Expert panel review and report generation (Step 4)

**Deliverable:** Go/No-Go decision for production deployment

---

#### Quarterly Audits (Every 3 Months)

**Scope:** Abbreviated (Steps 2-3 only)
- Re-check fairness metrics on new patient data
- Validate no bias drift over time
- Update reference dataset versions if changed

**Timeline:** 3-5 days
- Day 1: Data collection
- Day 2-3: Analysis (fairness metrics, output stratification)
- Day 4: Report generation
- Day 5: Review with clinical team

**Deliverable:** Quarterly Bias Audit Report (HTML + CSV)

---

#### Triggered Audits (As Needed)

**Triggers:**
1. **Workflow change:** New tool added, algorithm updated
2. **New data source:** Different reference dataset, new clinical data feed
3. **Bias incident:** Clinician reports suspected bias
4. **Regulatory request:** FDA, hospital quality assurance, external audit

**Scope:** Focused on changed component
- Example: If GTEx updated, re-audit gene expression bias only

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks depending on scope

---

#### Annual Comprehensive Audit

**Scope:** Full re-audit (all 4 steps, like Initial Audit)

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks

**Deliverable:**
- Comprehensive annual report
- Trend analysis (are we improving over time?)
- Recommendations for next year

---

### Audit Workflow (Step-by-Step)

#### Step 1: Collect Workflow Data

**Data Sources:**
```bash
# Genomics data
/data/genomics/patient_variants.vcf
/data/genomics/gene_expression.csv

# Clinical data (de-identified)
/data/fhir/patients_deidentified.json

# Spatial transcriptomics
/data/spatial/spatial_expression.csv

# Multiomics
/data/multiomics/rna_protein_phospho.csv

# Patient demographics (for stratification)
/data/demographics/ancestry_labels.csv  # Self-reported ancestry
```

**Data Requirements:**
- ≥100 patients per ancestry group (for statistical power)
- De-identified (no PHI)
- Ground truth outcomes (for fairness metrics)

---

#### Step 2: Run Bias Audit Script

**Command:**
```bash
cd /path/to/spatial-mcp

python infrastructure/audit/audit_bias.py \
  --workflow patientone \
  --genomics-data data/genomics/patient_variants.vcf \

#### Step 3: Review HTML Report

**Report Sections:**
1. **Executive Summary:** Pass/Fail, key findings, risk level
2. **Data Representation:** Reference dataset diversity table
3. **Fairness Metrics:** Demographic parity, equalized odds, calibration by group
4. **Output Stratification:** Treatment recommendations by ancestry
5. **Flagged Issues:** Disparities >10%, low representation, proxy features
6. **Recommendations:** Specific mitigation steps

**Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Are all ancestries represented ≥10% in references?
- [ ] Are fairness metric disparities <10%?
- [ ] Are confidence scores appropriate for underrepresented groups?
- [ ] Are demographic proxies (ZIP code, insurance) flagged?
- [ ] Are disclaimers present for Euro-centric references?

#### Step 4: Document Findings and Actions

**Create Audit Summary:**
```markdown
# Bias Audit Summary
**Date:** 2026-01-12
**Auditor:** [Name]
**Workflow:** PatientOne Complete Analysis

## Key Findings
1. **PASS:** All ancestries represented ≥10% in gnomAD, All of Us
2. **WARNING:** GTEx has 0% Asian representation → Flagged in reports
3. **WARNING:** Fairness metrics show 12% disparity for Asian patients (sensitivity: 90% European vs. 78% Asian)
4. **PASS:** No demographic proxies (ZIP code, insurance) have high feature importance

## Risk Assessment
**Overall Risk Level:** MEDIUM
- Genomics: LOW (diverse references used)
- Gene expression: MEDIUM (GTEx bias, mitigated by disclaimers)
- Clinical: LOW (no insurance bias detected)

## Actions Taken
1. Added ancestry caveats to all gene expression reports
2. Increased fold-change threshold for Asian patients (log2FC > 2.0)
3. Scheduled genetic counseling for 5 VUS cases in African patients

## Next Audit
**Date:** 2026-04-12 (Quarterly)
**Focus:** Re-check Asian patient fairness metrics
```

#### Step 5: Implement Mitigations

**If Bias Detected:**
1. **Immediate:** Add disclaimers to reports
2. **Short-term (1-2 weeks):** Adjust thresholds, add diverse references
3. **Long-term (1-3 months):** Retrain models with fairness constraints

**Example Mitigation:**
```python
# BEFORE: Single reference
expression_ref = load_gtex()  # 85% European

# AFTER: Diverse references
expression_ref = merge_references([
    load_gtex(),                  # 85% European
    load_topmed(),                # Diverse US
    load_human_cell_atlas()       # Global diversity
])
```

---

#### Step 6: Archive Report for Compliance

**Storage:**
```
