## Frequently Asked Questions

### "Can we use AWS or Azure instead of GCP?"
**A:** Technically yes (MCP servers are cloud-agnostic), but current deployment scripts and HIPAA-compliant infrastructure are GCP-focused. AWS/Azure ports would require 2-3 months additional development.

### "Do we need Epic? Can we use Cerner/MEDITECH?"
**A:** mcp-epic server is designed for Epic FHIR R4 API. Other EHR systems (Cerner, MEDITECH, Allscripts) require custom FHIR adapters. Development time: 4-8 weeks per EHR system.

### "What about on-premise deployment?"
**A:** Possible but not recommended. Cloud Run serverless architecture is optimized for GCP. On-premise would require:
- Kubernetes cluster setup and management
- Manual scaling configuration
- Higher operational overhead
**Estimate:** 3-4x higher infrastructure costs

### "How long does user training take?"
**A:** Depends on role:
- **Clinicians:** 2 hours (Streamlit UI, basic queries)
- **Bioinformaticians:** 4 hours (advanced queries, result interpretation)
- **Administrators:** 8 hours (deployment, monitoring, troubleshooting)

### "What if we want to add new data modalities?"
**A:** System is extensible by design. See: [Add New Modality Server Guide](../for-developers/ADD_NEW_MODALITY_SERVER.md)
**Timeline:** 4-8 hours from template to deployed server
