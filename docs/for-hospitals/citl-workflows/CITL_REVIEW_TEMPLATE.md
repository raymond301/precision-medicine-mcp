## SECTION 3: CLINICAL GUIDELINE COMPLIANCE ⭐ REQUIRED

### NCCN Guidelines Alignment
Review treatment recommendations against current NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) guidelines for this cancer type.

- [ ] **ALIGNED** - All recommendations follow NCCN guidelines
- [ ] **PARTIAL** - Some recommendations deviate from guidelines (explain below)
- [ ] **NOT_ALIGNED** - Significant deviations from NCCN guidelines (explain below)

**Deviations from NCCN Guidelines (if any):**
```
[List specific guideline deviations and justification]

Example:
- Recommendation for off-label alpelisib use: Justified by PIK3CA E545K mutation and platinum resistance despite Category 2B NCCN rating
```

### Institutional Protocol Alignment
Review treatment recommendations against institutional formulary and clinical protocols.

- [ ] **ALIGNED** - All recommendations follow institutional protocols
- [ ] **PARTIAL** - Some recommendations deviate from protocols (explain below)
- [ ] **NOT_ALIGNED** - Significant deviations from institutional protocols (explain below)

**Deviations from Institutional Protocols (if any):**
```
[List specific protocol deviations and justification]

Example:
- Bevacizumab continuation: Not typically used in platinum-resistant setting per institutional protocol, but justified by absence of GI perforation risk factors
```

## SECTION 4: QUALITY FLAGS ASSESSMENT

Review automated quality flags raised during analysis. Assess whether each flag is acceptable or requires action before approval.

### Flag 1: {{FLAG_CHECK_NAME_1}}
- **Severity:** {{FLAG_SEVERITY_1}} (critical / warning / info)
- **Message:** {{FLAG_MESSAGE_1}}
- **Recommendation:** {{FLAG_RECOMMENDATION_1}}
- **Reviewer Assessment:**
  - [ ] **ACCEPTABLE** - Flag noted but not concerning, does not affect clinical validity
  - [ ] **REQUIRES_ACTION** - Flag must be addressed before approval
- **Comments:**
  ```
  [Explain your assessment of this quality flag]

  Example:
  Minimum region size of 35 spots is acceptable. While below ideal threshold of 50, the strong effect sizes (log2FC > 3) and very low FDR values (< 1e-10) provide sufficient confidence.
  ```

### Flag 2: {{FLAG_CHECK_NAME_2}}
- **Severity:** {{FLAG_SEVERITY_2}}
- **Message:** {{FLAG_MESSAGE_2}}
- **Recommendation:** {{FLAG_RECOMMENDATION_2}}

  - [ ] ACCEPTABLE
  - [ ] REQUIRES_ACTION
- **Comments:**
  ```

  ```

### Flag 3: {{FLAG_CHECK_NAME_3}}
- **Severity:** {{FLAG_SEVERITY_3}}
- **Message:** {{FLAG_MESSAGE_3}}
- **Recommendation:** {{FLAG_RECOMMENDATION_3}}
- **Reviewer Assessment:**
  - [ ] ACCEPTABLE
  - [ ] REQUIRES_ACTION
- **Comments:**
  ```
  [Your assessment here]
  ```

**If no quality flags were raised:**
☑️ No quality flags - all automated checks passed
