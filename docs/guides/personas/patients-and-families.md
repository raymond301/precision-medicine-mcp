# 👥 Patients & Families

*You want to understand precision medicine for ovarian cancer*

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT

This is a **research demonstration**, not a clinical tool. Always consult qualified oncologists for medical decisions.

## What This Demonstrates

Precision medicine analyzes your unique cancer profile—genomics, transcriptomics, and imaging—to identify which treatments are most likely to work for you. This repository shows how bioinformatics can process this complex data, but it's research technology, not clinical care.

## PatientOne Story

This project is named in memory of a dear friend who passed from High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma (HGSOC) in 2025. Her journey inspired the development of these tools to help researchers understand and combat this devastating disease.
