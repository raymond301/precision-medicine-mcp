## ⚠️ IMPORTANT

This repository is for **RESEARCH USE ONLY**. Not validated for clinical decision-making, FDA/EMA approval, or patient care.

## What This Demonstrates

- How multi-omics data can identify potential treatment strategies
- Integration of clinical (FHIR), genomic, spatial, and imaging data
- AI orchestration of complex bioinformatics workflows
- Evidence-based pathway analysis (44 curated ovarian cancer pathways)

## Educational Resources

- **Case Study:** [PatientOne - Stage IV HGSOC](../../../tests/manual_testing/PatientOne-OvarianCancer/architecture/README.md)
- **Clinical Reports:** [Sample Outputs for Care Teams](../../../tests/manual_testing/PatientOne-OvarianCancer/architecture/patient-one-outputs/for-care-team/) - MCP reports, spatial analysis, multi-omics figures
- **Data Privacy:** [FHIR & De-identification Guide](../../../infrastructure/test-data/MOCK_FHIR_GUIDE.md) - HIPAA Safe Harbor method
- **Workflow Overview:** See PatientOne graphic above for data flow

## Educational Value

Understand precision medicine workflows • Evaluate bioinformatics pipelines • Assess multi-omics integration approaches

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is research technology, not clinical care. Always consult qualified oncologists for medical decisions.
