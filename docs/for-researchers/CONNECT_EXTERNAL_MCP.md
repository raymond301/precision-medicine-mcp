## Community MCP Servers (self-hosted)

Open source servers you install and run locally. Configure via `claude_desktop_config.json` or `claude mcp add` CLI. The server process runs on your machine (or connects to a remote endpoint).

### Hugging Face

Search and explore ML models, datasets, Spaces, and papers on the Hugging Face Hub. Run community tools via MCP-compatible Gradio apps. Useful for finding genomic foundation models, biomedical NLP models, and relevant datasets.

#### Setup

**Claude Desktop:** Add via Settings > Connectors > find "Hugging Face" > click Connect. Or configure manually — visit [huggingface.co/settings/mcp](https://huggingface.co/settings/mcp), select your client, and copy the config snippet.

**Claude Code CLI:**

```bash
claude mcp add hf-mcp-server -t http https://huggingface.co/mcp?login
```

Then start `claude` and follow the authentication prompt. Or use an explicit token:

```bash
claude mcp add hf-mcp-server \
  -t http https://huggingface.co/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_HF_TOKEN>"
```

**Get a free HF token:** [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)

#### Built-in Tools (7)

| Tool | What it does | Example use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Spaces Semantic Search | Find AI apps via natural language | Find a tool that can segment cell images |
| Papers Semantic Search | Find ML research papers | Search for papers on genomic foundation models |
| Model Search | Search models with filters for task, library | Find biomedical text classification models |
