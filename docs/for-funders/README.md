## What You Can Accomplish Here

- ✅ **Understand the value proposition** in under 5 minutes
- ✅ **Review detailed ROI analysis** ($3,098-3,176 savings per patient)
- ✅ **Evaluate technical readiness** (11 of 15 servers production-ready, 80 tools)
- ✅ **Assess investment tiers** ($50K pilot to $150K multi-site)
- ✅ **Review risk assessment** (LOW technical/compliance, MEDIUM overall including adoption and vendor dependency)
- ✅ **Access demo materials** for presentations and grant applications

## Why This Project Matters

**Dedicated to PatientOne** - a dear friend who passed from High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma in 2025.

**The Problem:**
- Stage IV ovarian cancer: **30% 5-year survival rate**
- Precision medicine analysis takes **40 hours** - too slow for urgent treatment decisions
- Manual analysis costs **$6,000-9,000 per patient**
- Most hospitals can't afford comprehensive multi-omics analysis

**This Solution:**
- **2-5 hours** for complete production analysis (genomics + spatial + imaging + clinical); 25-35 min DRY_RUN demo
- **$324-702 per patient** (projected, vs. $6,000-9,000 traditional) — modeled savings, pending clinical validation
- **Team compression** — reduces minimum precision medicine team from ~10 FTEs to ~3
- **Natural language interface** — bioinformatician oversight still required for clinical interpretation
- **HIPAA-compliant architecture** — validated on synthetic data, 6-month deployment path to hospital pilot
