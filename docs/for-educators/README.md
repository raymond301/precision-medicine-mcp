## Why This Is Perfect for Teaching

### 100% Synthetic Data
- **No patient privacy concerns** - Safe for classroom use, public demos, publications
- **No IRB approval needed** - Freely shareable with students
- **Realistic but synthetic** - Clinically plausible scenarios without real PHI
- **Two patient datasets available:** (see [PatientOne Profile](../reference/shared/patientone-profile.md) for full details)
  - **PAT001-OVC-2025** - Stage IV ovarian cancer (BRCA1+, platinum-resistant)
  - **PAT002-BC-2026** - Stage IIA breast cancer (BRCA2+, ER+/PR+/HER2-)

### Low Cost for Education
- **DRY_RUN mode:** ~$0.32 per complete analysis (synthetic data, no API costs)
- **Classroom pricing:** 20 students × $0.32 = **$6.40 per class session**
- **Semester course:** 15 sessions × 20 students = **$96 total**
- **Compare to:** Commercial platforms ($500-2,000 per student)
- See [Cost Analysis](../reference/shared/cost-analysis.md) and [DRY_RUN Mode Guide](../reference/shared/dry-run-mode.md) for details
