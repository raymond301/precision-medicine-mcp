# Runbook: Vulnerability Remediation

[← Back to SLA Overview](README.md)

---

## Overview
Procedures for addressing findings from Qualys, Security Command Center (SCC), or manual penetration tests.

## 1. Vulnerability Triage
| Severity | Criticality | SLA for Resolution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Critical** | RCE, SQLi, Unauth Access | ≤ 4 Hours |
| **High** | Data Exposure, Weak Encryption | ≤ 24 Hours |
| **Medium** | Info Disclosure, Configuration | ≤ 30 Days |

## 2. Patching Workflow

### Step 1: Identification
Review SCC findings Dashboard:
```bash
gcloud scc findings list <org-id> --filter="category='VULNERABILITY'"
```

### Step 2: Remediation
1. Update the base Docker image (e.g., `python:3.11-slim` image update).
2. Re-run `pip safety check` or `snyk test`.
3. Deploy new service version to Cloud Run.

### Step 3: Re-Scan
Trigger a manual scan to verify the finding is resolved.

## Verification checklist
- [ ] No "Critical" findings remain in SCC.
- [ ] Container registry scan shows 0 high-risk vulnerabilities.
