I need your help with a comprehensive precision oncology analysis for a 58-year-old female patient with Stage IV high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma who has developed platinum resistance.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: All patient data files ALREADY EXIST in this directory. Please USE THE EXISTING FILES - do NOT generate new synthetic data. Read the actual files from:

/Users/lynnlangit/Documents/GitHub/spatial-mcp/manual_testing/PatientOne-OvarianCancer/Synthetic_sample_data/

Patient ID: PAT001-OVC-2025 (this patient data is already created and saved in the above directory)

Key Clinical Features:
- Diagnosis: Stage IV HGSOC (High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer)
- BRCA1 germline mutation (pathogenic)
- TP53 R175H somatic mutation (hotspot)
- HRD positive (score: 42)
- Treatment status: Platinum-resistant progression

## Analysis Request - Please Complete All Steps:

### PART 1: Clinical Data Review (use mcp-mockepic to read existing files)

1. Retrieve patient demographics and clinical history:
   - READ THE EXISTING FILE: clinical/patient_demographics.json
   - This file already exists with complete patient data
   - Summarize key demographics, family history, and genetic risk factors

2. Analyze lab results and disease progression:
   - READ THE EXISTING FILE: clinical/lab_results.json
   - This file already contains CA-125 measurements over time
   - Analyze the trend from the data: initial diagnosis (~1456 U/mL), response to therapy (normalized to ~22 U/mL), progression/resistance (~389 U/mL), and current status (~289 U/mL)
   - Interpret the trend in context of platinum resistance

### PART 2: Genomic Analysis (use mcp-fgbio and mcp-tcga)

3. Parse somatic variants:
   - READ THE EXISTING FILE: genomics/somatic_variants.vcf
   - This VCF file already contains mutations for TP53 R175H, PIK3CA E545K, PTEN LOH
   - Parse the file and identify these key mutations
   - Note copy number alterations already annotated in the VCF (MYC, CCNE1, AKT2 amplifications)

4. Compare to TCGA-OV cohort (use mcp-tcga):
   - What TCGA molecular subtype does this patient match?
   - What is the expected survival for BRCA1-mutant, TP53-mutant, Stage IV HGSOC?
   - Are there other platinum-resistant cases with similar molecular profiles?
   - What pathways are commonly activated in similar cases?

### PART 3: Multi-Omics PDX Resistance Analysis (use mcp-multiomics)

5. Integrate multi-omics data from PDX models:
   - READ THE EXISTING FILES from multiomics/ directory:
     * sample_metadata.csv (ALREADY EXISTS: 15 samples, 7 resistant, 8 sensitive)
     * pdx_rna_seq.csv (ALREADY EXISTS: 1000 genes × 15 samples)
     * pdx_proteomics.csv (ALREADY EXISTS: 500 proteins × 15 samples)
     * pdx_phosphoproteomics.csv (ALREADY EXISTS: 300 sites × 15 samples)
   - These files contain real expression data - read and integrate them

6. Run Stouffer's meta-analysis (use mcp-multiomics calculate_stouffer_meta tool):
   - Focus on resistance pathway genes already present in the data:
     * PI3K/AKT pathway: PIK3CA, AKT1, AKT2, MTOR, PTEN
     * Drug resistance: ABCB1 (MDR1), ABCC1 (MRP1)
     * Anti-apoptotic: BCL2L1, MCL1
     * DNA repair: BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51
   - Use directionality from effect sizes in the existing data
   - Apply FDR correction (α = 0.05)
   - Which genes are significantly dysregulated across ALL three modalities?
   - What pathways are activated in resistant vs. sensitive PDX models?

### PART 4: Spatial Tumor Analysis (use mcp-spatialtools, mcp-openimagedata, mcp-deepcell)

7. Analyze spatial transcriptomics data (use mcp-spatialtools):
   - READ THE EXISTING FILES from spatial/ directory:
     * visium_spatial_coordinates.csv (ALREADY EXISTS: 900 spots with x,y coordinates)
     * visium_gene_expression.csv (ALREADY EXISTS: 31 genes × 900 spots)
     * visium_region_annotations.csv (ALREADY EXISTS: 6 spatial regions annotated)
   - These files contain spatial gene expression data - read and analyze them
   - Identify spatial regions: tumor core, tumor-stroma interface, immune-infiltrated areas
   - Which resistance markers (PIK3CA, AKT1, ABCB1) show spatial heterogeneity in the existing data?
   - Where are immune cells (CD3, CD8, CD68) located relative to tumor in the existing data?

8. Process histology images (use mcp-openimagedata):
   - READ THE EXISTING IMAGE: imaging/PAT001_tumor_HE_20x.tiff
   - This H&E image already exists - analyze the tissue architecture
   - READ THE EXISTING IMAGES: imaging/PAT001_tumor_IF_DAPI.tiff, IF_CD8.tiff, IF_KI67.tiff
   - These immunofluorescence images already exist - analyze them
   - Quantify tumor cellularity, CD8+ T cell infiltration, Ki67 proliferation index from the existing images

9. Cell segmentation and phenotyping (use mcp-deepcell if available):
   - READ THE EXISTING IMAGE: imaging/PAT001_tumor_multiplex_IF_TP53_KI67_DAPI.tiff
   - This 3-channel multiplex IF image already exists - segment cells from it
   - Identify cell types and phenotypes
   - Calculate cell density in different tumor regions

### PART 5: Integrated Analysis & Recommendations

10. Synthesize findings across all modalities:
    What are the PRIMARY resistance mechanisms based on genomics, multi-omics, spatial patterns, and imaging?

11. Therapeutic recommendations:
    Based on the integrated analysis, recommend targeted therapies, combination strategies, clinical trials, and immunotherapy considerations.

12. Biomarker identification:
    Which molecular and spatial features should be monitored for treatment response?

## Output Format

Please provide:

1. Executive Summary (patient status, key findings, primary resistance mechanisms)
2. Detailed Analysis by Modality (clinical, genomic, multi-omics, spatial, imaging)
3. Integrated Pathway Analysis (pathways consistently activated across all data types)
4. Clinical Recommendations (ranked treatment options with rationale)
5. Technical Summary (which MCP servers were used, data quality metrics, confirmation that existing files were read)

## REMINDER: Use Existing Data Files

All data files (JSON, CSV, VCF, TIFF) ALREADY EXIST in:
/Users/lynnlangit/Documents/GitHub/spatial-mcp/manual_testing/PatientOne-OvarianCancer/Synthetic_sample_data/

Do NOT generate new data. Read and analyze the existing files. There are 17 data files ready for analysis:
- 2 clinical JSON files
- 1 genomics VCF file
- 4 multi-omics CSV files
- 3 spatial CSV files
- 7 imaging TIFF files

Please proceed with reading and analyzing these EXISTING files.
